It will also show you how much money you are carrying, as well as how much experience points you need to gain your next level.~
#who~
By typing who at any point, you will see a list of all players visible in the game... their titles, levels, races, classes... including your own.~
Help who will give you more variations on how to get that list. It can be quite useful because the game can get quite busy, and rather than searching the whole list, you can search by class, race etc.~
#channels~
You already know how to use the "say" channel. Let's test out another of your channels.~
After level 3 you will have access to all channels. To see what is available type channels. A + or - indicates if that channel is on or off respectively. All channels can be toggled.~

By typing help prompt, you will receive more information on how to adjust your prompt to suit you.~
#bp~

As you gain levels, your hitpoints will rise.~

At a higher level, you will have a channel that only those in your class can see.If you type keywords found in your score, even "score", I can help you with those also.~

Skills, unlike spells cost nothing in the ways of points. But your character has to practice them (measured in %) to know and use that skill.~
Some skills are automatic, but most skills need a command from you to be used. Typing help skills and slist will give you some information on what skills you have or can use at each level of experience.~
