#### Note
We hope you will enjoy DikuMud, and encourage you to send us any reports on bugs (when you find 'it'). Remember that we are all using our spare time to write and improve DikuMud, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their time. We have so far put extremely many programming hours into this project. If you make any major improvements on DikuMud we would be happy to hear from you. As you will naturally honor the above rules, you will receive new updates and improvements made to the game.

## Merc

Release 2.2<br />
Wednesday, 24 November 1993

###  Program & Concept Created By

Kahn<br />
Hatchet

### Copyright and License Terms

Merc Diku Mud is a derivative of the original Diku Mud and is subject to their copyright and license agreement. Merc Diku Mud contains substantial enhancements to Diku Mud. These enhancements are copyright 1992, 1993 by Michael Chastain, Michael Quan, and Mitchell Tse.

In order to use Merc you must follow the Diku license (shown above) and our license.

Our license terms are:

* Copyrights must remain in original source.
* 'Help merc' must report our help text, as shipped.

Notice that our license terms don't include keeping our names in the login sequence. If you want to keep a line in there referring to Merc, or referring to us by name (Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn), we'd appreciate that, but we don't require it.  But you must keep the original Diku authors in the login sequence.

If you do not follow these license terms, we will ask you to comply. If that doesn't work, then we will talk to your system administrators (not about your running a mud, but on the grounds that you're using our copyrighted software without permission).

These are very generous terms for any software.  If you don't want to accept them, feel free to run some other software, or write your own.
