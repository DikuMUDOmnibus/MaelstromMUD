=== What's new in Envy 2.0

Many of the changes from Envy 1.0 release to Envy 2.0 were done by the
coding staff of EnvyMud.  A few were obtained from the merc mailing
list.  See 'contrib.txt' for acknowledgements.

We have kept logs of what we have done here in EnvyMud.  It helps in
backtracking what was done to the code.  It also helps others follow your
