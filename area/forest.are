The East Bridge~
The east bridge stretches over an unnaturally icy stream.  The bridge is
made of huge blocks of stone and is wrapped with ivy leaves.  The leaves
string towards the west, growing from the forest on the east.  City walls
lie towards the west, along with a large gate.  Towards the east, tall trees
stretch towards the sky.  A steep trail leads down under the bridge.

Tall trees surround this well travelled path.  Thick shrubbery and growth
around the path blocks any travelling towards the north and south.  The only
directions passable are towards the east and west.  A stone bridge can be
seen just slightly west of here.  The path travels deeper into the forest
towards the east.

The Forest Vale~
As you enter the forest you can hear the sounds of creatures scurrying
about looking for food.  The sounds of nearby twigs breaking from their
movements makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.  You begin
to look around and you can swear you can see movement out of the corner of
your eye.  But as you focus in that direction, you see nothing!  
To the south, a very thin path leads into a glade.

been secretly travelled, maybe under the cover of darkness.

The Forest Vale~
The forest grows denser towards the east.  The branches seem to reach out
and the trees extend higher and higher.  The thick roots begin to head
towards the trail, threatening its existence.

The surrounding darkness is unsettling, the shadows hiding their secrets
from all.  You hear something stirring behind you, but as you turn about it
is gone, just slipping from view from the corner of your eye.  A ray of
sunshine would be welcomed right now, though in all probability, it will
never happen.  Not here.

when you turn your head to peer through the darkness there by the side of
the path in the thick copse of trees, it is gone, as if it never happened.

speckle the ground about you just enough to reveal a fork in the path.  To
go north or continue to the east - both options seem equally viable, if not
a little bit disquieting.  You glance about for clues...

can be seen emanating from around it.  Scavenger birds circle the skies
above, obviously waiting for small dead animals.  Heat also can be felt

As your eyes adjust to the darkness you can see little blue flaming eyes
penetrating right through you.  You look around and notice these little eyes
in every direction but the one you came through.

There are fragments of fractured bones scattered about haphazardly.  Once
again there are blood stains splashed against almost every rock in sight. 
This must have been a very entertaining fight to see.  As you look over the
edge of the cliff you realize that you have almost reached the base of the
mountain.

Cliff Edge~
The climb here seems very simple.  The rock is holding very well.  With
this in mind you are able to climb very readily.  Looking down you realize
that you have almost reached the base of the mountain.

You find yourself back in the forest vale.  The sounds of animals
searching for prey returns to the still air.  The eeriness of the forest
almost makes you want to climb back up this great mountain and face the
dangers there.

The path continues along the side of the great mountain that you have
just climbed down.  The physical and mental exertion from the climb is
starting to take it's toll on you.  You feel that you are being watched by
something in the near distance.

The path now takes a sharp turn to the south along the edge of the
mountain.  Once again you feel that there is something lurking in the
darkness of the forest ahead of you.  But being a great adventurer like

The Forest Vale~
This dead-end in the forest is ominous.  The trees around you bear
various deep claw marks.  Barkskin ripped out in large chunks litter the
ground.  The only exit is back south.  All other directions are impassable. 
A rather unpleasant place to be caught and cornered in.

The Forest Vale~
The forest that surrounds you is like none that you have seen before.  In
a way it looks altered from it's original state.  The trees do not grow
straight but are twisted and angulated in strange patterns.  The grass has
slowly turned a putrid yellow with no hopes of return to its original
beauty.  It is most likely caused from the volatile creature that inhabits
this area.

You notice that the temperature is starting to rise as you come closer to
the east wall. A strange wooden pannelling can be found here. You can see
many gouges and scratch marks upon it. Perhaps the gouges are big enough
for you to take a peek.

The room is filled with old weapons and armor... most of which are
of no use any longer. This brings you to the conclusion that this is a
guard post of some sort. There must be something important lurking about.

The Mequi's Cave~
The temperature in this dank cave rises dramatically here.  It is almost
unbearable combined with the humidity and stench of this wretched place.  A
dim light is provided by a strange moss covering the walls.  It emits an
eerie feeling all around.  Steps are crudely carved leading upwards into
darkness.

As you venture to the east you notice that the temperature is not as bad
as you thought before.  You realize that it must have been a safe guard
against unwanted intruders.  This part of the cavern is larger than the
rest.  The walls are smoother and cleaner.  The temperature here drops to a
comfortable level.  A low gutteral sound and scratching can be heard, then
the clinking of chains ring from the east.

Upon examing the walls you notice a great deal of scratch marks.  There
are even pieces of finger nails embedded in the wall with it's skin still
dangling from it.  It appears that whatever is brought up here, does not
enjoy the experience a great deal.

King Mequi's Quarters~
By the looks of this room there have been many battles here, as the walls
are so covered blood that they are stained to a black in color. A few corpses
of unidentifiable humanoids lie about the place, one of them still fresh and
a small trail of blood flows still from its now lifeless body. The floor is
a puddle of blood.
