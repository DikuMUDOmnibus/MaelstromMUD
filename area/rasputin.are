marize dominatrix~
Marize the Dominatrix~
Marize stands here with her whip in hand!
~
Marize is a tall, masked woman.  Her long, black hair hangs loosely on her
shoulders.  The corset she wears is fixed with spikes and shackles.  In her
firm hand, she holds her whip.  You gasp at the sight of her legs - they
seem to be as long as your entire body.  The thigh high boots she wears, are
made of leather, just like her other garments.  You feel helplessly inferior
to Marize.

of the woman the maid talked about.  Marize, was the name.  How
could she have done such a thing?

be a dead end.  You turn to the right wing and squint your eyes as you
are nearly blinded by a bright light.  In the center of the intersection
lies a statue of stone.  It's shape is that of a nude woman.  The

as you become more submissive.  Your mind relieves you of all ambitions. 
Many mortals have passed through here at one point or another, but few have
ever felt the desire to leave.  Here you will be taught how to obey your
superior.  Proceed to the north, if you survive.  Obedience is the only

room is very high.  Several chains hang from it.  The soft glow of candles
provides an almost calm atmosphere.  Marize's bedding is made of red satin.
You kneel before your mistress and lower your head.

it is only set for one.  As you look into the china cabinet near the

but no clothing.  Even the drawer on the desk, here, proves to be
empty.  A red chair has left imprints in the carpet from being in
the same place for too long.  On the ceiling is the panel that leads
to the attic.

The Bathroom~
This bathroom seems very symmetrical.  There are two sinks, two
showers, two toilets, two of everything.  To the left is the
hers side, while to the right is the his side.  There are walk-in
closets here.  You think to yourself that the owner of this house
must own a lot of clothing.  Near the far wall, you see a large
bathtub.  Further examination of it reveals that it is also a jacuzzi.
Behind the faucets, a weaved basket is filled with scented soaps.
Their smell create a charming atmosphere.  If only you had brought a
bottle of bubblebath oil.

The Piano Room~
The room you enter is quite small.  You wonder how they ever managed
to fit that Grand Piano in here.  There are several ornaments which
have been placed onto the piano.  Amongst them you notice the
sculpted heads of many famous piano players.  There is a pile of
music books in one corner of the room.  You raise your hands to hit a
few notes, but stop yourself in time.  Perhaps you should take a few
lessons from Mrs. Benson first.

The Door to the House of Domination~
You have reached the front of the House of Domination.  The facade
of this abode is immense in size.  It appears to be two stories
high, however there may be some floors beyond your sight range.  The
house is made of brick and looks quite modern.  The front door is 
also quite large.  The golden doorknob matches the mailbox fixed on 
the wall.  Some of the curtains have been closed in the upstairs
windows.  For a moment you think you see the outline of a person 
looking down at you.  An inviting doormat lies below the door.

brush a few spider webs out of your way and take a look around.
Many tarnished brass objects lie here.  Some furniture and a few
large garbage bags are also scattered about.  The housekeeper
obviously does not come up into this room.  Dust is everywhere.  In
the far corner of the room is a small, metal box.

in this room.  In each isle, a small carpet has been placed.  Some of
the plants seem to be moving.  Could it just be the shadows?  As you
take a closer look, you realize that they might be carnivorous.
Perhaps you should be careful around them...after all, you are not
exactly a green thumb!

in.  A large CD collection is stacked besides the Sony stereo.  A
50 disc changer that would make Kirk proud is all loaded up.  Just hit
play and you'll have some White Zombie, NiN, Ministry or even some
Pink Floyd.  There are a few guitars lying around.  I wouldn't touch
them without permission if I were you.
