The Troll Bridge~
You have reached a bridge crossing the Troll river. The bridge is old and
decaying and looks like it can fall at anytime. Off in the distance, you
can start to see what appears to be a huge mountain. From here, you
can only see the top of the mountain which is all covered in snow.
There is a large box at the end of the bridge with a sign covering it.
The air stinks of rotting flesh.

Trail to Troll Mountain~
You find yourself on a trail following the river up the mountain.  The
trail is well worn and from the tracks, it appears due to some very large and
heavy creatures.  You should think twice before moving on. These creatures
could very well be the death of you.  The mountain looks larger from here
and more beautiful then before.  You can start to make out what appears to
be caves in the side of the mountain.

a tunnel that leads down into the earth below the mountain.  Looking to the
north you see a large boulder and you sense there is something behind it
that warrants further investigation.

bones on the ground.  Taking a double take you also notice a human skull or
two. The creatures of this cave must have a wide range of tastes. Maybe you
should head back the way you came.

more bones covering the floor here making it very difficult not to make
noise.  Hearing a sound you look up and see a shuffle of a figure above you.
This is your last chance to return south and head home.

Climbing up to investigate further you see a rather large troll before you
eyeing you up and down. Luckily for you, he doesn't seem to think of you as a
threat to his village or you would probably be dead now.  Using the force
of your will, you take your eyes off the troll and look around the entrance
to what appears to be a large cavern inside the mountain.  You notice small
holes in the ceiling that you can feel a soft breeze bringing in fresh air
to this otherwise stale place.  You may continue onward through the village
to the north or return down and go home.

from the outside.  Luckily for you, this room is empty or you could be the
next appetizer for the clan trolls.  There is a nasty odor coming from the

You notice all kinds of raw meat around the room and looking closer at the
meat you notice there are some big juicy bugs crawling around on it.  There
are no bones in this room and you wonder what they did with them all.  Then

You have slid down a garbage slide into this garbage pit. The smell is 
is unbearable and you pass out. When you awaken you find yourself deep in
garbage. You feel like you really should not have waken up but then you  
feel something moving beside you. The slime mold beside you leaves no
question as to what happens to the garbage here as you see it slowly   
dissolving the bones around you. Searching for a way up, you see all the
slides that lead down here but only one seems climbable.

Hunter's Den~
You have entered a large hunter's den.  This room is filled with trophies
of all kinds of animals. There are several different types of each animal.
Each is a prime specimen of that race. Looking closer, you see a head of a
Dwarf and one of a Pixie among others.  Maybe if you're lucky, you might be  
considered a prime specimen also and your head will join the others in the
room. Of course the cave troll that is here might just decide to eat you.

Watch Tower~
Climbing up to investgate further, you see a rather large troll before you
eyeing you up and down. Luckily for you, he doesn't seem to think you're a
threat to his village or you would problably be dead now.  Using the force
of your will, you take your eyes off the troll and look around the tower and
you notice that you can see everything in the cavern from here.  You notice
small holes in the ceiling that you can feel a soft breeze bring in fresh
air to this otherwise stale place.  You may go north further into the tower
or head back down.

are supposed to be waiting for. This room, like the others in the tower,
affords a great view of the village below.  The air is definitely fresher up
here being closer to the vents. There are two unmarked doors here. One to

You have entered the room of the clan's shaman.  She is a peaceful cave
troll if ever there was one.  She is here to heal her fellow clan members
but really doesn't care who she heals.  This room is lined with all sorts of
herbs and things that the shaman needs to practice her art.  You have a good
view of the cavern from here.  It is really amazing how the trolls used the
natural stalactites and stalagmites to form the walls of the passageways. 
The only exit is the door you entered to the west.

Entering the cave troll chief's office is not the best idea you had
today.  The chief is very angry.  You realize this as he begins to attack
you.  From this office he can see everything that goes on in the cavern that
is probally why he is so angry at you.  You notice that this office is quite
and comfortable.  How odd it is compared to the rest of the village.  Of
course that is also the reason the chief has not left to kill you earlier. 
The only exit is the door you entered from to the east.

The ground here is level and smoothed out.  Around you, molten streams of
lava flow slowly.  Through the hazy air, you can make out what appears to be
a village, composed of small huts that litter the interior of this cavern. 
Small vent shafts carry air down into this otherwise stale place.  The
cavern expands to the north, while a tunnel to the outer world is to your
south.

Light shines up from the clear floor and the lava pit beneath it.  No wonder
it is so hot down here.  Slits in the ceiling bring fresh air from the
outside.  Luckily for you this room is empty or you could be the next
appetizer for the clan trolls.  There is a burning odor coming from the
floor.  There is a door to the east with a sign on it.  To the west is what

trolls.  The women and children spend most of their day here preparing the
kills that the hunters bring back.  The room is lit, but poorly ventilated,
by the air slots in the ceiling that you noticed before.  Raw, uncooked meat
is stewn around the room.  Bugs in search of carrion crawl about the floor. 
The nauseating odour of charred flesh waffs up from the floor.  Strangely,
you notice an absence of bones...

notice there are some big juicy bugs crawling around on it.  There are no  
bones in this room and you wonder what they did with them all.  Then you 
smell a God awful smell of freezing flesh coming from the floor.

Ice Huts~
&BYou have entered the living quarters of the ice trolls.  The women and
children spend most of their day here preparing the kills that the hunters
bring back.  They look at you and think they can never have to much meat.

Watch Cliff~
&BClimbing up to investigate further, you see a rather large troll before
you eyeing you up and down. Luckily for you, he doesn't seem to think you're a
threat to his village or you would problably be dead now.  Using the force
of your will, you take your eyes off the troll and look around the tower and
you notice that you can see everything on the cliff below from here.  You
notice that this cliff is actually polished ice supported by the snow walls
below.  You may go east further onto the cliff or head back down.

Waiting room~
&BContinuing east on the watch cliff, you enter what appears to be a
waiting room.  Chairs line the walls here but give no hint as to what you
are supposed to be waiting for. This room, like the others on this cliff of
ice, affords a great view of the village below.  The air is definitely
fresher and cooler up here being closer to the top of the mountain.  The
floor of this cliff is translucant due to the highly polished ice it is made
from.  There are two unmarked doors here one to the south and one trapdoor
up.

Ice Troll Chief's Hut~
&BEntering the ice troll chief's office is not the best idea you had today.
The chief is very angry. You realize this as he begins to attack you. From
this office, he can see everything that goes on in the cavern. That is
probably why he is so angry at you.  You notice that this office is quite
comfortable. How odd that is compared to the rest of the village. Of course, that is
also the reason the chief had not left to kill you earlier.  The only exit  
is the door you entered from below.

Shaman's Hut~
&BYou have entered the room of the clan's shaman.  She is a peaceful ice
troll if ever there was one.  She is here to heal her fellow clan members
but really doesn't care who she heals.  This room is lined with all sorts of
herbs and things that the shaman needs to practice her art.  You have a good
view of the cavern from here.  It is really amazing how the trolls dug the
village from the snow of the mountain. The snow must be a hundred feet deep
to be able to make such a huge village.  The only exit is the door you
entered to the north.

of all kinds of animals. There are several different types of each animal.
Each is a prime specimen of that race. Looking closer you see a head of a
elder and one of a human among others.  Maybe if you're lucky, you might be  
consisered a prime specimen  and your head will join the others in the
room. Of course the ice troll that is here just might decide to eat you.

You have slid down an ice shoot into this ice pit. The smell is
unbearable and you pass out. When you awaken, you find yourself deep in
garbage. You feel like you really should not have waken up but then you
feel something moving beside you. The ice cube beside you leaves no
question as to what happens to the garbage here as you see it slowly
freeze the discarded scraps around you. Searching for a way up, you see
all the slides that lead down but only one seems climbable.
