blade of grass.  The humidity combined with the heat coming from the thick
vegetation makes the heat almost unbearable.  The trail continues north and

You are in a clearing at the edge of a great plain of grasses.  To the
north is a very high wall that stretches well into the grasses on either
side of you.  In the center of the wall is a pair of massive wooden gates. 
Each gate is opened to the outside, almost as if to invite you in.  You can
also follow a path to the south.

A Tomato Patch~
Small green bushes with a tangy scent grow in several rows here.  You take
a closer look and see large, juicy ripe tomatoes growing in abundance and
realize that that's where the scent is coming from.  A gardener was recently
here, for you can see his hoofprints in between the rows of freshly tilled
earth.  West of you is another part of the garden and south is a corn row.

A Small Vegetable Garden~
You step into a small garden, carefully moving between the rows of
vegetables so that you don't damage the growing plants.  Radishes, potatoes,
and other veggies have been carefully planted here and lovingly taken care
of.  You see no weeds growing anywhere in the precious food supply.  To the
east and south of you are more plants growing and the village road is to the
west.

strong.  The sounds of children playing reaches your ears as well as the
occasional fly buzzing nearby.  North of you is a large well and the gates
are to the south.  West of you is the smell of something baking.  You peer
to the east and see some kind of garden growing.

You are in a large burlap tent.  All around you are sacks of grains and
barrels of vegetables.  A large board has been set upon two barrels as a
counter and behind the counter are various types of sweets.  A black iron
stove seems to have some kind of pastries and other edibles cooking in it
and you notice a display case of the products for you to buy.  You can leave
the tent by going east.

You walk into this tent are are greeted by cooler air than outside.  The
small pool in front of you probably contributes to that.  You wander about
the tent looking in the various curtained areas and come to the conclusion
that a well-off family must live in here.  The only exit out is to the north
of you.

looking.  You discover a cooking area, a bathing area and several sleeping
areas, none of which seem to be occupied at the moment.  The only exit seems

A medium sized granite well has been dug deep into the ground.  Wooden
poles have been set around and on it with a rope tied to it to lower a large
bucket down into the well and bring up the ice cold water.  There's a lid on
top of the well itself to keep dust and other foreign objects from falling
into the water below.  Exits are east and west down lanes with small centaur
children playing on them.  You can also go north to the village square or
south to the village gates.

was built around the tree instead of the tree being planted after.  A small
circle of grass grows around the tree looking ideal for resting your tired

Your feet might crunch loudly on this black, volcanic rock road.  Unlike in
other parts of the village you find no plants other than the plains grass
growing nearby.  The heat here is almost unbearable and you smell sulphur
coming from the northwest of you.  You can travel along the road to the west

inhabitants have no problems getting around in the store.  General supplies
of all kinds are packed onto shelves and in barrels.  A cool breeze blows

are obvious as you look at the large flaming forge before you.  Weapons,
armor and horseshoes line the walls and shelves on the far end of the
building.  The only exit seems to be to the south.

portrait~

his upper body ripple as he holds his spear before him.

place. The pungent aroma from a cauldron reach your nose, as you spot it
simmering in the middle of the room. This is obviously some sort of shaman's
room, and he might not be happy you're here.

North and east of you are more rooms within the tent or you can go back
outside to the south.

you assume that it's to ward evil spirits from entering.
