window is set in one wall with a table below it.  To the South an archway
leads into yet another room.  Looking at the floor you see a &Ytrapdoor&G.

Large candles on both sides of the West door fill the air with sweet
incense.  Pews line both sides of a narrow aisle, centered on a tabernacle
to the East.  A mural adorns the Northern wall, showing a holy man with a
white aura.  His lips form a gentle smile, and a mere peasant kneels before
his feet.

Bottom of Spiral Staircase~
&wA spiral staircase, cut from granite blocks, leads upwards into
darkness.  The stone walls are filled with magical runes etched into the
hard granite by a powerful mage.  Torches are mounted on the wall, giving
the runes a magical aura as the flames flicker softly in a draft.

Fortress.  The glowing runes are so strong they create an imaginary
crescendo of warning.  Torches on either side of a door located on the South
wall light up the words, 'Disturb at your own peril!' The granite
staircase winds down into the darkness...

inscribed on the floor.  A red candle burns at each point, and strange
glyphs are drawn on the walls.  Electric charges spark in the air and the
floor wavers in the center of the pentagram.  Some of the glyphs look
different from the others.  Broken staffs and wands are scattered on the

blanket tossed on it.  A worn desk with a tattered chair is located in the

if they've all been well taken care of.  A few other items are located on
the shelves and some may even be magical.  A variety of staves and wands are

Hallway of the Keep~
&pYou see a number of pictures lining the wall, many depict major battles
that Lord Tyrus took part in.  Each has a date listed below it and they
proceed in chronological order.  The last dated picture is a strange one
though, it depicts this very Fortress straddling the pass.  Over the
Fortress a black sky reigns and lightning bolts burst forth to strike some
of the towers.  Among the black clouds some very vague shapes can be seen as
if the painter wanted the viewer to almost see a mind behind the storm.
Under the painting the plaque showing the dates has the starting date, but
no finishing date.  The hall continues East and West.
