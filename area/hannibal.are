Entrance to the Fortress~
You arrive at the front gates of a HUGE fortress.  It spans probably a
mile from on end to the other.  It is fashionned from dark black bricks that
seem to have been welded together.  It is like looking at a huge puzzle.  In
front of you are the gates to this dark looking place.  There is a small
outpost for guards next to one of the gates.  Either leave or enter, because
staying here is a bad idea.

Inside the Fortress~
The inside of the Fortress is dark and ominous.  Evil can be felt and
tasted in the air.  Strange sounds float from the northern passageway.  Deep
and hollow, it is best to be wary there.  A cast iron door hangs to the
east.  An &zEbon Banner&c is engraved deep into the metal.  Directly west is a
wide passage leading it seems, to a southern tower.

Entrance to the Hall of the Black Knights~
A dark arch adorned with violent depictions of battle serves as the
entryway into what seems to be a large hall.  Thick &Rcrimson &ccarpeting
covers the floor.  The walls are decorated with silk banners.  Shields and
weapons are delicately embroidered onto the banners.  An extreme sense of
evil and danger radiates from this hall.  Sounds of footsteps and armor can
be heard from what seems to be all directions.  Echoing in this unholy
bastion.  The source of the mysterious sounds can not be seen.

End of the Hall~
The end of the Hall allows passage deeper east, into the source of the
strange mist.  Danger and despair flows through this room.  The sounds of
the barely visible denizens of this Fortress seem to be closing in on this
room.  The mist grows thicker...  As does the fear.

Hall of the Black Knights~
Surrounded by complete &zdarkness&c...  The Hall of the Black Knights
pulses with raw evil.  The light sounds of footsteps and clinking of armor
come from all around this room.  Standing in the center of this room, one
would feel as if they had lost their sight.  A wispy mist, barely noticable,
blows from the east.  The smell is bittersweet and sickly.

South-Western Corner of the Hall~
The corner of the hall is pitch black.  Without a light, darkness reigns
supreme.  The carpeting hugs the wall tightly.  Almost trying to absorb the
walls itself.  In the dimness, the walls itself look as if it is absorbing
what little light is shining.  Devouring the light and warmth.

Southern Section of the Hall~
The southern wall is the only visible surface here.  Deep carvings can be
seen in the stones.  They resemble letters of a language that is
undecipherable.  Although, the structure of the words are in the shape of a
poem.  A single word can be made out, '&RIhsan&c'.  All except the wall and
letters are shrouded by the cloak of darkness.

South-Eastern Section of the Hall~
The darkness grows thicker in this corner.  Light struggles to shine as
the hall spreads inky blackness.  The sounds of footsteps softly moving
about is clear as a bell.  The lack of light seems to have heightened sounds
in this area.  A porticulis is barely noticable towards the north.  It can
be seen due to a strange and sinister glow radiating further east.  The wall
is decorated with images of a single heavily-armored paladin.

Ihsan's Shade's Chamber~
As you cross the porticulis, you notice a clear change in the room
atmosphere.  The room is lavisheously furnished, there is a huge table in
the middle of it.  There are paintings depicting angels on every wall.  Upon
closed inspection, you can see that the canvas where some of the angel's
wings are has been torn.  You see a huge statue in a corner of the room; it
seems to be a paladin of the highest order.  At the base of the statue is a
small plaque.

&zHere you come upon another curve in the hallway and again to the north.
Even though you are venturing at a slight incline downwards, the hallway
seems to open up somewhat here and afford a bit more room to move around.  
The spooky part is, however, that it has become deathly quiet here...

way past the rubble and debris that has sloughed from the walls and ceiling
of this damp earthy place.  The smell of fresh-dug earth and slimy
earthworms and fetid mulch stings at your nose.  The smell is stronger to

you find that they are not small and wrinkling old men, but nubile young
damsels caught up in the throes of devotion and worship for their god...

&wWithin the &rAbandonned &zTower&w~
&wYet another corner of this dismal place reveals nothing to you.  The
dust floats up from your every footstep, nearly blinding and choking you.  
You cance to wander further and hope not to get lost...

&wStill nothing of interest avails itself to you here.  But from the
south you feel a draft and a shifting of air.  You notice that the dust
seems to swirl a bit more here instead of floating aimlessly.  The cobwebs
don't seem as prolific here, as well.  You strain your eyes to see more
clearly...

&wYou immediately feel a draft from above and instinctively look up. 
Upon careful inspection, you discover a place in the ceiling that has been
worn away to expose an opening.  You crane your neck and peer at it, but
nothing discernable can be seen.  Broken beams and splintered boards aford a
way to climb upwards for a better look.

&wThe darkness here conceals nothing of great importance as you grope
your way around the room.  Dust and small debris litter this neglected
place, making exploration easy, if not hazerdous.  You peer into the
darkness trying to find your way.  To the south is a paneless window.  A
shutter hangs from it's broken frame.

&wMiraculously, you make your way to the roof of the tower.  What is left
of it, that is, for it is broken and in bad repair.  Rotted boards threaten
to break and spill you into the abandonned room below should you not
practice extreme caution.  Stray splinters of wood crack underfoot and
possibly announce your presence here.

through the thick dark clouds which surrond the entire structure.
