The Cano Chief, dressed in his customary ceremonial garb, is an imposing
figure in the room.  His deep blue eyes watch your every move through the
Cano ceremonial mask.  Fortunately for you, he likes to talk to guests, so
it appears there is no threat of a surprise attack.  With the mean looking
skull on his stick, he can probably smash through stone with one swing,
though you dont want to test your theory.

Entrance to an Ancient City~
You are in the entrance to a long lost city.  The people who lived here
were great scholars of the magic of fire, and accordingly, built their home
here in the base of the volcano.  The streets are lined with black rock,
with strange mystical runes inscribed upon them, the streets look deserted.

Ancient Domecile~
This room is modestly furnished with a bed and a desk.  The mystics who
lived in this city found little need for pleasures of the flesh, instead
concentrating entirely on their arts.  Although so much time has past, the
magic is still keeping all traces of age off of the furniture.

desk bed furniture~
The furniture hasn't been used in a long time, though no dust has settled
on them.  When you inspect the desk, you find remnants of paper long ago
burned to a crisp.

City Square of Ancient City~
The mystics who once inhabited this city had little need of such mundane
things as armour and weapon stores, even food was created through magical
means.  You marvel at the intricately engraved buildings, and ponder the
question of what sort of force could have destroyed such a powerful culture.

Ancient Domecile~
You are in a small room, in the room is a bed and a desk.  You marvel at
the simple living style the mystics had adopted for their use.  It was said
that they were originally mages, but after so much research into the spells
of fire, that they had practically created their own class.

bed desk furniture~
The furniture is untouched by dust and dirt, probably from a spell cast a
very long time ago.  You wonder at the power of these beings that their
spells can last so long.

Main Street of the Ancient City~
You are on a serviceable black road.  The people who inhabited this city
had little use for art and ornaments.  The walls have a nice warm feel from
them instead of the dreadfully hot burn that the walls outside the city
have.  Using the volcanos natural heat, the mages spells hold the
temperature at a comfortable level.

You are in the midst of a great heap of burned shelves.  Looking at the
walls you realize that the fire that burned all of the books in this library
had been carefully controlled, because the walls are entirely free of any
scorch marks.

Entrance to the Great Library~
You are at the entrance of an enormous library.  It easily takes up half
the size of the city.  The shelves look burned and destroyed, you marvel at
all of the information that was lost.

The shelves are totally charred.  No information on the inhabitants of
the Lost City has been spared by the flames.  You wonder what power these
beings had in their time of glory.

Southwing of the Great Library~
You are in the midst of a great heap of burned shelves.  With all of the
magical protection of keeping the great heat of the volcano off of you, you
wonder how it was possible that a fire could destroy all of the books within
this huge library.

Before the Great Book~
You are in a large room, the floor is completely clear of any rubble, and
in the very center of the room is a large book on a huge pedestal.  This is
the only thing in the entire room besides the two huge candles placed on
either side of it.  As you enter the room, the candles flare into life.

You appear to be floating in a red haze.  The protective magic around you
is preventing your destruction.  There is no longer any solid rock to stand
upon, this is the very bottom of the volcano, and probably close to the
center of the planet itself.
