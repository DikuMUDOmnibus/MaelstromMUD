is a land known far and wide to harbor many adventurers.  Many among them
are tested by fate, showing their great abilities and quick wit.  Good

here, and a sign hangs from it reading "Bethaven Badlands".  Left of where
you stand is an old wooden signpost.  Conan can usually be seen here as

Dunes~
The dunes don't seem to end, as the horizon piles up with neverending
desert.  Scorching rays of the sun touch your face as it burns your eyes. 
For miles and miles there is no water to be found.

Upon a Dune Hill~
You come atop a hill, scanning your area before you.  Several insects
move around you, especially those annoying scorpions.  You realize your
consequences as you ponder the fact that there might be headhunters around
looking for your scalp.  You duck hard and fast, placing your nose on a well
rounded position in the sand.

Horizon~
As you sit on a dune hill, you see the nice sun setting on the horizon. 
Your adventure will be long and hard, but soon you will be a formidable
enemy.  You rest here now pondering about the future and the treasures it
holds before you.  This may be the only time you will ever again get a nice
long sleep.

More Dunes~
You come down from the hill, managing to camouflage yourself unnoticed. 
It was a quick getaway and a sure gamble for being safe.  On the western
horizon, you see the sky fogging up slightly.  To the east is a dune hill
tall enough for a great lookout.  Everywhere around you, dunes, dunes and
more dunes.  And on the southern horizon, as you guessed more dunes.

Desert Path~
The desert path leads to the horizon.  On each side of the path, the
skeletal remains of a soldier seem to be strung on a pole.  The bones seem
old and start to reek from the sun's exposure, at the same time your skin
starts to burn from the massive heat the desert produces.  You make sure you
have enough water left in your waterskin in case you run into trouble.

As you come down from the path, you notice a clearing suddenly appear
before your eyes.  An oasis is not far off to the distance.  A small tent
has been pitched north of here, by an arab merchant.  You feel lucky for
once as you think of the more plentiful days of water.

From the nights and days you have ventured through the desert, you finally
see this oasis.  Palm trees grow wildly around here.  The edge of the desert
can be seen only a few feet from where you stand.  While you conquer one
situation, another is at hand.

You are on the southern edge of the seiged tower, positioning yourself

fearful of your life.  You suddenly notice, from the corner of your eye a
living entity.  An animated skeletal creature has been disturbed and has
been awaken from the dead.  Are you ready to do battle with this monster

From inside this plain hut, you can see that it is very well furnished if
you disregard the rickety state of the furniture itself. A few chairs surround
a small table that is topped off with a bowl of water and several rags. A small
area carpet (or ragged blanket) centred on the floor brightens up the area
with its many colours.
