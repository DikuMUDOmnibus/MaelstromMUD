Entrance to the Tower~
Before you is the entrance to a rather small tower.  It looks as if it
was used as a scouter's outpost at one point in time.  The bricks are faded
and the condition of the stones is just short of being called a complete
wreck.  It's a wonder that the tower is still standing..

The Base of the Tower~
You stand in the base of the tower.  It is rather cramped, with barrels
and bags lining the walls.  It looks as if the barrels and bags are rations,
buy you can't be sure.  In front of you is a stairway leading up to the rest
of the tower.

Stairwell~
This stairwell is dark and musty. Everything around you is not pretty
to look at, and the stairs are even worse. Each step you take results
in a loud creak...

First Landing~
After a nervous trip up the stairs, you arrive on the first landing.  The
room is dark, save the light coming from arrow slots in the walls.  More
barrels and bags line the walls.  The dust in the place is amazingly low,
then you soon realize why.  A man dressed in a dark cloak is pacing around
the room, a sword in hand.  A trapdoor above you closes off the stairwell.

Stairwell~
You continue up the stairwell of creaky wooden steps.  No much is
different from the stairs you travelled on earlier.  The air is musty and
hard to breathe, and you cough mildly.

Second Landing~
The second landing looks almost identical to the first.  Barrels and bags
line the walls and light shines through arrow slots.  Above you is another
trapdoor, but the key is nowhere to be seen.  A man wearing a heavy grey
cloak is standing here.  Maybe he knows where the key is..
