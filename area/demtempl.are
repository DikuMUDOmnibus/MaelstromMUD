Kyrax temple guard towering~
Kyrax~
Kyrax, Guardian of the Demon Temple, looks down on you with a sneer.
~
Kyrax stands seven feet tall, looking down on intruders with an air of
supreme confidence.  He appears to be a normal, although huge, human being. 
But as you take a closer look at him, you see that his eyes glimmer with an
unhealthy shade of red.  Lurking behind those eyes seems to be an evil
intelligence that you have never encountered before.

A monstrous Demon Guard~
A monstrous Demon Guard stands here, towering over you.
~
An ugly guard stands here guarding the doorway.  At first glance he
appears to be nothing but an abnormally huge human.  But as you look closer
at him, you see fangs poking out from his lips, and no human you ever met
had dark, glowing red skin.  Are those jets of steam coming out of his
nostrils?

A black priest~
A black priest stands here, staring at you with eyes darker than night.
~
You feel a chill steal over your skin as you gaze at this dark creature. 
He is clad in a pitch black robe that looks as wispy as silk yet hard as
stone.  His eyes are the purest black, and you can see no white in those
dark orbs.  The faintest gleam of dark red emanates from the very center of
each eye.

Path to The Temple~
You see before you a massive temple that looks ancient beyond belief.  It
is shaped like a pyramid, yet its color is like nothing you have ever seen. 
The sides seem to be drenched in dark, glistening blood that pulses with
power and overwhelming evil.  As you take a closer look at the huge
structure in front of you, you notice that the temple is not made of stones,
but rather seem to consist of overlapping scales, perhaps of some extinct
species of dragon.  The light of the sun seems to dim noticeably around the
temple, and you feel a chill as you step into the darkened clearing.

Entrance to The Temple~
You stand before the entrance to the temple.  A stout iron door, also
blood-red and made of the massive scales of a dragon, blocks your way into
the temple.  You can now faintly hear screams of fear and pain even through
that thick door, although it is not clear if those awful sounds are made by
humans or animals.  Also barring your way into the temple is a towering
guard clad in blood-red, scaly armor.

Temple Foyer~
Your senses are assaulted as you step into the darkened temple. 
Guttering torches set in the walls cast flickering lights across the foyer,
yet the corners remain dark and hidden.  You smell the combined stench of
rotting and burning flesh, and the agonized cries of unfortunate souls ring
in your ears.  The ceiling seems to be literally dripping with blood, and as
you watch a drop of dark blood falls onto you, burning a small hole into
your armor.

Temple Foyer~
You stand at the southeast corner of the temple foyer.  Somehow it seems
much darker here, and some strange sounds seem to be coming from the
blackness of the deepest corner.  A distinct chill steals over your skin as
you enter this area, and deepens as you approach the north.  To the west you
can see the entrance to the temple, and to the north lies a black door.

Temple Foyer~
You stand in the southwest corner of the temple foyer.  A sickly red
flame burns atop a blackened torch in this corner, casting a red glare
across the surroundings.  As you come closer to the torch, you start to hear
insane giggling and howls of mad laughter.  It might be a good idea to stay
away from that torch...

Temple Foyer~
You stand in the middle of the temple foyer.  The light seems a bit
brighter here, but you feel a malevolently evil force to the north.  The
agonized shriek of a dying soul pierces your ears before being suddenly cut
off.  To the east you can see a black door, and a chilly draft wafts across
your skin as you peer over there.  To the west lies a red door, and the
blood dripping from the ceiling seems to emanate from that direction.

Temple Foyer~
You stand at the northeast corner of the temple foyer, before a huge door
apparently made of obsidian.  The door seems to suck up the weak light that
the torches emit, and the pitch black surface of the door gives off no
reflection whatsoever.  As you come closer to the door, the temperature of
the room seems to drop below freezing, as the pulsing blackness of the door
seems to absorb any heat around it.  Standing before the door is a monstrous
guard who looks less than human, and bars your passage with a huge black
battle-axe.

Temple Foyer~
You stand at the northwest corner of the temple foyer, before a door that
seems to be made of blood.  The dark red liquid flows up from the ground and
spreads out over the ceiling.  A dark black keyhole seems to float in the
moving river of blood that makes up this unholy door, and you feel the
presence of dark magics at work.  Standing before the door is a monstrous
guard who looks more than human, and bars your passage with an axe made of
living blood.

You stand in the bend of a dark hallway.  There are fewer torches along
the wall here, and they barely throw enough light for you to see the
blood-red walls.  To the east you can barely make out what looks like a huge
staircase.  The inhuman screams that you hear now make an unceasing chorus
that drives into your brain like an icy spike.

beings far larger than you.  You cannot see the top of the stairs in the
shrouded darkness, although the screams of agonizing terror seem to be
coming from that direction.  The step in front of you is made of a rough
stone, and is covered in glistening, warm blood.  You might be able to pull
yourself up onto the first step if you can find a grip on the slick stone.

be actually seeping out from the dark stone underneath, and your feet begin
to feel uncomfortably warm.  It might be a good idea to get off this step
before the blood finds its way to your skin.

The blood on the ground now seems to be bubbling and gurgling along the
step.  It splashes against your legs and feet and small tendrils of smoke
arise from where droplets spatter against your armor.  You can almost hear
demonic whispers and the insane babbling of lost souls above the sounds of
the sloshing blood, but it is probably better that you cannot hear those
voices clearly.  Ahead of you stands a sleek black step made of pure
obsidian.

that seems to emanate from this pitch black stone.  The floor and walls seem
to suck all the heat from your body, and it seems darker on this step, even
though the torches seem just as plentiful up here.  The screaming from up
above seems to be getting even louder.

The temperature seems to be steadily dropping as you make your way across
the surface of the step.  You cannot tell if the deep chill emanates from
these two stolid figures, or from the massive block of black ice that makes
up the next step.

no apparent flaws.  You are about halfway up this huge staircase, and now
you can see neither the top nor the bottom in the darkness of the temple.

through your boots and into your toes.  Before you stands a step apparently
made of burning embers, yet you feel no heat from that direction.  Before
you also stands two priests, giving you a chilly stare of their own.

The Corner of &RBlood~
There is a constant river of blood flowing from the temple altar into
this corner of the shrine.  It collects into a pool of dark, viscous red
fluid, and an unpleasant warmth seems to emanate from this source.  The
blood ripples and seethes in the corner, seeming to take on a life of its
own.  The blood also flows up the walls from this corner in defiance of
gravity, spreading out over the ceiling and the rest of the temple.

stands in the center of this room.  The ceiling rises toward the sky in the
shape of a thin knife, far beyond the reach of the torches' illumination. 
Although you can see no windows, small wisps of wind caress your skin,
seeming to whisper of madness and lost souls.  Ahead you can finally see the
source of the screams, as a dark figure prepares to sacrifice his next
victim.

This corner of the demonic shrine is strewn with black obsidian rubble. 
If you do not watch your step you are likely to twist an ankle or scrape a
leg on the sharp, irregularly shaped rocks.  As you take a closer look into
the corner, you can see what looks to be a huge outgrowth of pure obsidian. 
It appears that the stone is slowly emerging from the walls, and has
gradually taken over this corner of the shrine over many long years.

glistening with the color of fresh blood.  Even in the uneven, flickering
light of the torches, you can make out depictions of the unspeakable actions
of the demons.  Here you can see hordes of people enslaved by demon masters,
demons mutilating and torturing humans while wearing inhuman grins of
gleeful madness, and other visions that make you turn your eyes away.

table that looks like it has seen ages of use and thousands of victims. 
Blood drips from a hole in the table down into a wide gulley, where the red
liquid flows into the southwest corner of the shrine.  Beside the table
stands the High Priest of this Temple, preparing to sacrifice his next
screaming victim.

are sure you can hear maniacal laughter coming from those very flames.

demonic temple, and the dark evil emanating from the altar is almost
palpable.  The shrieks of agony you heard on the staircase now seems to be
coming from directly ahead, but your vision is fogged by a misty darkness
and a strange red glare.

definitely not human.

from the floor that reminds you of animal entrails, although if you take a
closer look at the floor, you see bits and pieces of flesh that must have
come from human bodies.  Surrounding you is a vast expanse of blackness in
every direction.
