The Avatar of Meliki~
A roughly humanoid creature is surrounded by bursts of energy.
~
This creature is surrounded by multicoloured burst of chaotic energy. It seems
to fade in and out and even disappears from one part of the room to another.
The closer you get, you feel a pull of sorts... almost as if the Avatar was a
magnet and you were a piece of steel--powerless against its force.

A voice booms in your head, "Come mortal! Bask in my Chaos!" and leaves a
ringing in your ears. Did the Avatar speak to you, or was it an illusion?

&bAlways standing in the shadows, this slim man seems to move with both
grace and power. His voice seems to eminate from everywhere at once but is
strangely very soft.

As he notices you watching him, he chuckles to himself and then in that
quiet almost dreamy voice he murmers, "Chaos is all around you, and in the
end it will consume your very soul."

Doli walks about, seemingly oblivious to everything, talking to himself in some
strange sluring language you have never heard.  He is of medium height, with
close cropped dark brown hair.  Just as you think he will sweep by you without
acknowleging your presence he startles you by intently peering into your eyes,
then as if not finding what he sought he mutters just a bit louder and stalks
away.

near its muzzle. Its mane is a &r&rreddish&g-&wgrey&g, and dull black eyes
dart to and fro in a mad frenzy. The look of shabbiness hangs about it in
every way. It looks as if it hasn't had a bath in several months and all
its clothes could use a good washing (or a good burning). In spite of all
that it looks like he put put up a tough fight.

in the light. Head held high and prancing around the courtyard, he seems
suffused with both raw energy and a white light. As he senses your gaze on him,
he stops his prancing a bit to study you. Then after what seems like quite a while under the power of his eyes, he
snorts and prances away.

Darkbreeze is Baldor's nightmare steed. Very few mortals ever put bridle on a
nightmare. Perhaps this says something about Baldor's power. As it senses you
approaching, it snorts fire and it's eyes glow red. It's coat is coal-black and
its eyes burn with a fierce unearthly fire as its flaming hooves leave scorch
marks on the ground. Then just as you begin to think you mayget away, it raises
its hooves above it's head and charges you.

some thinking on your part.

Dianyasis~
A breath-takingly beautiful woman lounges in an ornate throne-like chair.
~
From the moment you enter the room, her eyes pierce you and seem as if to look
into your very soul... as if passing judgement on you in some way. As you begin
to regain some small semblance of composure, you notice a few other things about
the room you are in and the woman who occupies it. The pools of blood on the
loor and the pale skin leads you to believe that this woman is a vampire.
Then as if she reads your mind she speaks to you, "So, you realize what I am,
do you? You believe you can kill me?"
Then she laughs at you and looks away, as if in contempt of you and your
powers.

What do you wish with the Mistress? he asks in a firm voice.
She has little time for peasants like you.
Saying that, and wearing a very smug look indeed, he resumes staring beyond you,

riches or what have you. His goal now is to take the place of Derion as the
protector. After that, he is unsure, but it is always more power and money he
looks for. As you enter he judges if you will brink either. After deciding you
could, in fact, provide some prestiege (if he killed you, of course) he makes
his attack.

"Hello wanderer," she says in a weary voice. "I continue my battle with the
chaos that infests this place day and night. It pains me to see you hurt, as
I am from the surrounding evil. I am beginnging to feel weary to my very
bones from holding back the evil... but as long as I am here, you need fear

&BA watery serpent peers its head out of the basin in the centre of the room.
~
&BThe water weird is somehow formed from living water. It pokes its head out
of a very large basin that is positioned in the exact centre of the room.
The basin is very orante and holds about one hundred fifty gallons of water.
Although the room is huge, the water weird can apparently reach all the way
across the room. You notice this because as you are studying it, it is closing
in on you. Almost too late, you realize that there are several broken weapons
and rusty pieces of armour scattered around the room. It seems that the water
weird has disposed of several other adventurers like yourself.

Driders are the evil work of Lloth, the Spider Queen of the Underdark. When
a drow reaches a certain level, Lloth puts them through a test of some kind.
Those who fail the test become these hideous monsters.
The drider is a large  bloated spider from the waist down, and its upper
torso and head is that of a dark elf who failed the test of Lloth. They
remember their previous existance and live in constant torment and anger. As
the drider sees you approach, it attacks with a vengeance.

You now stand before a great shining temple that seems to radiate with a faint
bluish light. There are three towers at the corners of the huge structure that
are twisted at a strange angle. The twenty foot doors that lead into the great
temple are thrown wide open welcoming all who wish to enter and bask in the
wonder of pure chaos.

chaos~
&YThe basic definition of chaos is the total absence of order. Chaos is
simply a state that is the embodiment of a total lack of order. Many see
chaos as an evil thing, but this is not true. There are many agents of chaos
who hold too many of the "traditionally" good views, but they simply choose
not to follow the path of order in achieving their goals in life.
~
E
rifts~
Rifts are a fairly new thing to us now. Meliki is just beginning to allow
our priests to explore with them. The basic idea is to rip a small hole in
the very fabric of the existance and then with the help of the great Meliki,
to cast many spells on it to stabalize it. After this is done we can move
through it at will. At the time of this writing Vladimer and all the priests
of the Order of Meliki are workingon the greatest test of our knowledge of
portals. They are attempting to make a portal to another planet! That test
will answer many of our questions regarding the portals.
~
E
gathering~
It has been long known that the Great Meliki has sought to reduce the whole
of the world to total Chaos. The building of the Temple of Chaos has given
him much more power as it will serve to be the focus of his powers. He has
been gathering all those who follow the ways of Chaos for many generations
now, and it is generally believed that he will soon send his followers out
oon the final rampage to desecrate all the world.
