say A long time ago, the criminal

say a crime here.  Females from 
say around the world were brought
say here to complete their sentence
say but as civilization advanced
say the people forgot about this
say place.  The older this place
say got the more sinister this place
say became.  One day a mysterious
say mist travelling from the south
say settled here.  Warriors, army's
say were sent here to investigate
say this strange phenomenon, and 
say once in never came back out.
say and over the years the people
say named this place Lairich the
say Valley of Mist.  A place that
say whoever ventures in it never

face, but she's clearly human lacking several of the common physical
characteristics of halflings.  She's wearing a dark blue apron covered with
dough.

one you want to mess with.  He has a sword belted across his waist and a
dagger sheathed within his tunic also adding to your suspicion that this man
knows how to sell and wield his weapons.

A stockly built gateguard stands here watching your every move with intent.
~
You size the guard up with your glance noticing his rather well trained
stance, ready to handle any problems this town may incur.  One hand lies
above his eyes shielding them from the sky's light while the other rests on
the hilt of his sword.  His armor glistens with an almost glassy look while
made of chain rings making you wonder if it's completely natural.

Tameran~
Brier, Captain of the Guard, sits here at his desk frowning at your intrusion.
~
He seems rather annoyed at your presence and gives you a glance before
returning to his work.  A dagger is sheathed at his belt along with a sword
on the opposite side.  His gauntlets are removed and lying beside him while
he works making his armor look incomplete.  His dark eyes once again look up
at you as he removes his axe from his place across his back.  Something
makes you think now would be a good time to leave him be.

A large lion with silken fur as black as a starless night stands proudly
before you.  He looks at you with intelligent sky blue eyes and you feel as
if he's looking into your very soul.  He casually unsheaths a razor sharp
claw to remind you that he's more than capable of protecting his master.

&wYour heartbeat quickens but is it with excitment or &Rfear&w? You feel
&wan almost tangible pull as the silence seems to almost sing you towards it
&wand beguile your senses and paralyze your will. There is a sign rooted in

Lori's Bakery~
Lanterns hanging from the ceiling offer only a small amount of light as
you step further in.  No windows are present to add in nature's light, which
strikes you as a little odd, although that could be so more space could be
made for shelves and cupboards like the ones that cover the walls in all
directions.  A cauldron sits over a small fire surrounded by cobblestones to
make a firepit.  Beneath the cupboards runs a long counter running the
length of the west wall and bending down the south one some.

east wall.  A long tail stands at the back of the room.

North of Entrance to the lairich~
&b^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&wYou have decided to brave the mist and the unknown and the unseen. As you 
&w venture further in, you sense this eerie presence all around yet you cannot
&wphathom the source nor can you see it. You only sense an awesome power. 
&wYou can only see a few feet around you and then the &zgrey &wblanket that
&wconsumes the rest. There are strange looking plants in hues of &Bblue &wand
&Wwhite &wlying all around in a hazy blur.
&b^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
