One of the Bethaven horsemen throw you unto the ground face first.  You
manage to lift up your head as you see the soldiers head off.  In front of
you is a land far and wide known to harbor many adventurers.  Many among
them are being tested by fate, showing their great abilities and quick wit.
Good experience is abundant here as the land is big.  An old battered wooden
gate stands here, and a sign hung named "BETHAVEN BADLANDS".  As a new
adventurer you fear the adventure that lie before you.  Left of where you
stand is an old wooden "SIGNPOST".  You might also remember Conan from
another village, he stand a few feet from you.

Upon a Dune Hill~
You come atop a hill, scanning your area before you.  Several insects
move around you, especially those annoying scorpions.  You realize your
consequences as you ponder the fact that there might be headhunters around
looking for your scalp.  You duck hard and fast, placing your nose on a well
rounded position in the sand.

Horizon~
As you sit on a dune hill, you see the nice sun setting on the horizon.
Your adventure will be long and hard, but soon you will be a formidable
enemy.  You rest here now pondering about the future and the treasures it
holds before you.  This may be the only time you will ever again get a nice
long sleep.

More Dunes~
You come down from the hill, managing to camoflouge yourself unnoticed.
It was a quick getaway and a sure gamble for being safe.  On the western
horizon, you see the sky fogging up slightly.  To the east is a dune hill
tall enough for a great lookout.  Everywhere around you, dunes, dunes and
more dunes.  And on the southern horizon, as you guessed more dunes.

Dunes~
The dunes don't seem to end, as the horizon piles up with neverending

Desert Path~
The desert path leads to the horizon.  On each side of the path, the
skeletal remains of a soldier seem to be strung on a pole.  The bones seem
old and start to reek from the sun's exposure, at the same time your skin
starts to burn from the massive heat the desert produces.  You make sure you
have enough water left in your waterskin in case you run into trouble.

A Clearing~
As you come down from the path, you notice a clearing suddenly appear
before your eyes.  An oasis is not far off to the distance.  A small tent
has been pitched north of here, by an arab merchant.  You feel lucky for
once as you think of the plentiful days you have water in your mouth.

see this oasis.  Palm trees grow wildly around here.  The edge of the desert

situation, another is at hand.

"They are only stick and stones!"  Well not here, the oasis is filled
with life.  Ferns and Palm trees grow wildly here in this desert paradise.
The sun barely shines on your face but the warmth gives you deep security.
While slashing your way through the underbush, scratches have started to
cover your whole body.  The terrain is often mistaken but thus it is still
hard to get around.

You are a wet fish indeed, coming out through that waterfall.  On your
left side glitters an etched sign of an unknown language, you better see it.
Undoubtedly there is something different here because a chill has rung
through your whole body.  Shadows eminating from below has cast you
bewildered.  The is a glowish hue coming from below, a wet ladder seems to
lead you to go down.  There is a strangely carved entranceway leading off to
the north from here.

mirrors strung all around the walls.  There are many windows, but you cannot
tell because of the mirrors.  Directly in front, you notice a silver throne
shimmering a blinding light.  In the middle of the room sits a table, where
four circling skulls protect a rather odd shear.  Sitting right of the
entrance is a bean bag where Nar the Lightning Hound sleeps peacefully.  So
this is Tiberon's Abode.
