&GYou see a middle aged oriental man with a missing right eye.  He is
dressed in a &ppurple&G and &zblack&G uniform with a &Ygold&G sash tied around his
waist.  Master Chu looks as if he wasn't expecting to see you or anyone else
at the moment. It is obvious that he is a battle hardened vetern who has lived
through many battles.

Within a Secret Passageway~
You can still catch the sound of faintly dripping water around you, yet
the ground here is dry and packed down into a smooth trail.  To the north of
you, if your eyes are not playing tricks, is some sort of oriental style
structure, covered in carvings and statues made of gold.  It appears to be
some sort of battle ground, or some sort of ancient temple of worship.  You
can faintly see what seems to be Lukin Wan engraved on the door, time would
seem to have almost made it vanish.

Dojo Catacombs~
You are in a bend in the passageway.  The graves that have been set into
the walls are empty, but they seem to have been used recently.  You see
pieces of rotten flesh scattered about the dirt floor.  The dank air smells
of death.  The passageway continues south and far to the east.

Dojo Catacombs~
You are just north of an alcove.  The graves that have been set into the
walls here look untouched.  The bodies in them look ancient.  The floor is
littered with pieces of rotten flesh and fleshy bones.  You hear an odd
humming noise coming from the alcove.

Dojo Catacombs - Alcove~
You are inside an alcove deep withing the catacombs underneath the Dojo
of LuKin Wan.  The floor seems to be covered in spare body parts and rotting
gore!  There is an odd humming noise coming from somewhere in this room, but
there doesn't seem to be any other exits other than back the way you came.
