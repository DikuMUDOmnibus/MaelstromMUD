Krotz~
The Daern's personal Smithy stands here.

Krotz is a burly dwarven man. His beard reaches to his mid-belly and his
eyes reflect the fires of the forge. Beneath his eyes are dark rings which
you assume are either from the soot on his hands, or from lack of sleep due
to his long hours at the anvil.

her thin waist.  Her eyes as deep as the deepest, darkest earth; framed with
long and thick lashes.  She is built thin but not brittle, and voluptuous
where it counts.  Heart-shaped lips part slightly with a grin, making her
more deceiving than you'd hope to think.

A pixie sits at the counter playing tiddly-winks with a few polished stones, and an empty snail shell.
~
Nartika is a small woman, hence her pixie heritage... she has long blonde
hair (which is tucked neatly behind her pointed ears), and slanty blue eyes
with possibly the longest eyelashes you have ever seen. She is a thin girl,
perhaps too thin, as her collar bone protrudes from her chest noticeably. But
this aside she is an attractive young girl, seemingly about early twenties in
age. Sheer wings peer out from behind her when she turns her back to you, and
they sparkle with silver lining as the light reflects from them.

not a thin woman, although would not be considered fat either. Let's just say
that the law of gravity has distributed her weight in all the wrong places. A
round face framed with straw-like white hair would be friendly to look at if it
weren't for her lazy left eye and the many wrinkles that show her age of many
many years.

The Unicorn's horn spirals up to the heavens from its forehead with a blue 
glow, and its innocence beguiles even the vilest of evil.

A large room in the basement~
This large room contains a few serving carts, and serving trays. Piled
up on a shelf on the east wall there are towels, table cloths, and napkins. 
This seems to be the room where the servants might prepare to bring dinner

This pathway is again surrounded in the familiar rose bushes that grow to
make your path, and to keep you inside the grounds of the garden. However,
little trees also line your path here, they're trunks rise up to about five
feet and weeping branches droop out from the tops. Each trunk of each weeping
fig has been braided at youth, and thus they all have a different trunk 
pattern. The path takes you to the north and to the south.

you and you can still catch up to them... maybe they know of a way out! But
they could also be an enemy waiting for you to follow them to your doom. The
only thing to do is continue in the direction you are headed to find out. The
rose bushes grow rapidly here, the weeping figs sway in the breeze, and the
wildflowers smile back at you as you go by.

Nartika's Necessaries~

piece of furniture inside is part of the toadstool that hasn't been carved
away. There is a little counter at the north end of the place, and a few
little shelves on each of the east and west walls. The smell of cinnamon
lingers on here very strongly, perhaps too strongly for your liking. If you
are larger than four and a half feet you have to crouch or squeeze your
front end in through the door to catch a peek. A little window carved out
in the south east wall allows the natural light to shine in.

A Fern Path~
The rose bushes outline the pathway here, and along the base of all the bushes
grow patches of thick ferns. Some of the fern branches reach out onto the path
at your feet, and you step cautiously around them so as not to crush them.

The rose bushes are thick here, much like the entrance which brought you into
the garden. You can hear the familiar rustling of the leaves as they grow before
your eyes, and the thorns pierce out menacinly at you with a gleam. The 
occasional wildflower can be seen along the path, and they seem to be smiling
back up at you.

you see nothing but the rose bushes you have see throughout the garden. Could
there be a body of water here? Or is it just your ears playing tricks on you

The Fountain Home~
&GA beautiful garden is here before you!  Even though the sickening maze
of a garden has (by now) made you dislike vegetation so much that you were
considering vegetarianism, you can't help but bask in the glory of this
beautiful scene.  The hedges are cut splendidly here into shapes of various
animals of the continent, and even one in the likeness of Bethaven's own
Oracle.  The rose bushes have all but disappeared in this area, almost as if
they had no power in this part of the garden.

sizes of glass bottles and flasks filled with odd-coloured liquids. A large
black cauldron sits over a hearth along the east wall, and from the ceiling
above there are different animal carcasses hanging from a thin piece of
rope. It is quite dismal in here, because the only lighting is severeal
large candles floating about the room.

night tables line the east and south wall.  Various items rest on each
table, such as make-up, a hairbrush, mirrors of all sizes and odd things
like dried bats wings, incense, different herbs and other such oddities.

been marked in the dirt by the passage of rabbits, deer and some undecipherable
