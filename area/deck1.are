Before the Quest Hall~
Around you stretches an endless blackness, devoid of motion and color.
An endless emptyness that strips away sight and your every noise disapears
as if never being.  The platform you stand on is almost indistinct, it's
edge lost to the blackness no light source can remove or reveal.  To your
north a door stands on the edge of the platform or in the middle it is hard
to determine but it stands to the north.  The door is framed in a gold arch
contrasting with the plain polished wood of the door.  Carved into the door
is the signent of Decklarean, a sword reaching for the stars ablaze with
power, half in darkness, half in light.

You are in a field of flowing red grass.  A wall of glowing grey fog
blocks your passage to the north and west.  It is a physical barrier, when
you touch it is like touching a solid wall.  There is some distance above to
the grey fog blocking the way up.  There is a strange gate to the southeast
appearing to hang on nothing.

High above in this part of the Great Hall of Champion a scene of Yenlar
hunched over a map in a dark forest.  Monster of all discriptions are hinted
at in the shadows of the woods, but Yenlar is stairing down unaware at his
map.  The flame of his torch doesn't appear to the be the factor in holding
back the monster.  The rembered bight of the gleeming sword being used
casualy to hold his map flat appears to be the more potent deterent.

This part of the hall seems darker than that to the north and south.  A
shadow lies here that darkens your soul Above you the image is swirling
darkness and shadows.  It all centering around Nemesis, his eyes gates into
hell, no mercy ever existing in him.  Cloaked in darkness wouth a soul of
evil, a pure hatred radiates from him.  His mouth a vishes smile as he walks
across the shattered remains of the innocent.

Greet Hall~
The Great Hall of Champions stretches before you to the north.  Massive
vaults reach to the sky above you, painted in scenes of battle of legendary
champions of the mud.  Above you Galad is depicted triump over the Dragon
Prince.  Aglow with magic shields and power enhanced swords burning with
chaos.  He is an avenging angel sent from the gods.  Yet concern and
resignation battle with each other in the fire of his eyes, a fire that
radiates from his soul.  His right hand is clenched around the hilt of a
shattered sword raised in triump.  Blood smeared face and shattered armor
covered in gore, all attest to his bravery.  Yet all is drawn back to his
pearcing blue eyes, demanding respect, and peering into your very being.

Pavilion in the woods~
&YYou are in a small pavilion, made of unfished wood.  Apparently cut
from the surronding forest.  It looks like it was tossed together in a rush.
The ground is covered in a soft turf and a large stump to big to be removed
with shovel and axe dominates the northeast corner.  A much used fire pit is
just out from under the cover of the pavilion east side within easy reach of
someone sitting on the stump.  Signs of a bit of fire damage can be seen in
the ceiling near the fire pit.  The sounds and smells of the deep forest
surrond the place.  Giving you a deep sense of peace.
