of darkness.  This one seems to be more of the scholarly type and looks to
be a bit annoyed at your intrusion into his room.

A Cherry Blossom Tree~
In the center of a small island is a large cherry tree.  Its branches are
completely covered with cherry blossoms.  An unseen musician plays a soft
melody on reed pipes.  You feel yourself nodding off as the music and the
fragrance of the cherry blossoms work at putting you into a nice, relaxing
slumber.  A small fish pond lies to the west of you.

A Bathing Chamber~
You stand within a large bathing chamber.  Towels, silken robes, spices
and oils line the large tub in the center of the room.  It looks deep enough
to relaxe within and be thoroughly cleansing.  A small window overlooks the
pond outside to the north of you and you can see cherry blossoms float by
the window.  It looks as if the bath is continually cleaning itself as the
water flows in and out from a grate that you assume is directly connected to
the small pond.

A Tea Room~
You stand within a small room adorned only with a small table that sits
low to the ground.  It is in here where the mayor and his guests all sit
around the table and perform the tea ceremony that holds so much importance
to this village.  It doesn't look as if one is being held at the moment so
it seems safe to look around.  A door leads out to the east and you can the
sounds of pots being hit together coming from the south.  Or you may go to
the reception area to the west of you.

The Aviary~
You take in your surroundings and smile in content.  You'd never think
that here, in the middle of the desert, you'd find so many trees and birds
in once place.  Peacocks, nightingales, canaries and a multitude of other
birds create a loud cacophany of noise.  Whomever owns this aviary obviously
cares for it quite a bit.  The only obvious exit seems to be through a rice
paper door to the west.

&RYou stand in a room with rice paper walls and red painted wood.  The
wardrobe and chest of drawers have been stained to a deep red, matching the
crimson curtains on the window that adorns the west wall.  The bed is
dressed in red velvet bed covers and pink silk sheets.  The only obvious
exit out is through a door to the east.

The Stage~
You stand upon a large wooden stage.  Red silk curtains look like they
lead to some kind of room to the east of you and to the west of you you can
see rows of logs for people to sit on as they watch the shows.  Small cubby
holes are to the north and south of you for actors and dancers to wait for
their cue to go on stage.  Wooden katanas and other fake weapons lie strewn
about waiting for their owners to pick them up and resume their mock
battles.

The Dressing Room~
You find yourself within the dressing rooms of the dancers' pavillion.
Costumes of all sorts are hanging from pegs and from the backs of chairs.
Props for many different performances rest within the wardrobes standing
along the wall and small instruments sit within their cases.  A counter with
a large mirror is lined with make-up and perfumes.  The only obvious exit is
through a curtain to the west.

&WYou sink low into the tub, letting the warm waters soothe away
all your aches and pains.  No worries trouble you as you splash
about. Along the edges of the tub are various oils and spices
to add to the water for your choice of aromatherapy. Now if you
only had someone to wash your back to get those places you have
a hard time reaching for yourself...
