Entrance to a Grand Memorial~
You are at the entrance of what can only be thought of as a great
memorial to a long dead king.  You see that a great signature rune has been
enscribed upon the archway going over your head.  The smell of incense is
very intense here, although you don't see any burning.

Bend in the Memorial Corridor~
You are in a bending corridor.  Upon the walls are pictures of a young
man.  The man looks proud and strong, and upon his head is a crown of gold,
and in his hand is a shining sceptre.

Northern Part of the Great Hole~
You are in a large sand dune inside of an ancient tunnel.  There is a
great hole in the west wall of the pyramid.  Looking west you can nearly see
across the entire desert.  In the distance is a small grey blur.

Top of a Spiralling Staircase~
You are at the top of a tightly spiralling bronze staircase.  You look
dizzily down into the dark gloom, with no hope of seeing the bottom.  It is

Ancient Weapons in the Memorial~
You are in a narrow corridor.  Embedded into the rock is an assortment of
weapons.  This must be the dead kings choice of armament.  Looking at the
glow cast from the stones, it would seem that the weapons are held magically
in place, probably preventing theft.

Middle of the Great Hole~

this corridor is missing, and looking upon the eastern wall you see huge
claw marks running across it.  Some of the stones themselves look almost
melted, as if acid etched them.

Inside an Ancient Sarcophagus~
You are in a cramped coffin.  It is dry and musty, and smells of rot.  This
seems strange considering that the pyramid has stood so long, you would
think that any corpse placed in here would have long since decomposed.
Perhaps it was part of the ancients magic that kept the body from rotting
quickly.

the ancient king had died in battle.  Again the magic within the room
prevents the burglary of this armour.

avian creature has made this ledge it's nest.

Looking carefully at the spikes you realize that they are not made of metal,

There is a glow through the mist to the west.  Shore must be near by.
