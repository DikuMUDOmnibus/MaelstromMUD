There are three body size holes dug into the floor and filled with dirty
straw.  Upon closer inspection you realize that these are beds.  A broken
wooden crate serves as a table and there are no chairs at all in the place.

Path Through Villein Ville~
The road you are on is packed dirt, pot holed and in general disrepair. 
There are a few dead trees in the area, dried beyond hope of rejuvenation. 
You are walking through what is obviously a serf village.  It seems the lord
of this area does not take his duty to protect his serfs very seriously. 
The road continues north and south from here.

You are in the Villein Ville town square.  Although a fair size, the
square is run down and dirty.  It seems that no one in the village has the
will or the desire to look after the place.  The flag stones under your
feet, once laid with loving hands, have been worn smooth over the years.  In
spots they are stained with a deep redish brown and you wonder if
maybe an execution or two has not taken place here.  You can follow the
square to the east and south or there is a road leading north. A sign is

aren't expected to live long as the want for food increases.  There is a
fresh bouquet of wild flowers placed at the head of the grave.  There is a
note placed on the cross.  It seems to be an epitaph.

wood you can see that it is a cemetary.  There are trees that hang darkly
all around the graves.  Weeds grow rampantly and shamelessly.  The cemetary
has a kind of road in between the graves and you see that it continues south

not encounter such haggling.  You can travel south through a large mass of
debris, if you so desire; it is not, however, advised.

windows on the main floor and balconies outside the upper story windows. 
Flowering vines grow up the building adding a splash of color to the pure
