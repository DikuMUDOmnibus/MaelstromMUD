Deathfang kurat~
Kurat~
&CKurat, One of the &Runholy defenders&C of the Manor
~
The Kurat Guards are what you could call primal.  They appear to have
only come out of the tree's within the last century or so
They are truly hideous beasts, with hairy bodies consisting of a brown matted
fur and long tusks that are upturned at the snout.  They are however
very loyal to Raisk, for who knows what reason. And they guard the halls
of his Manor efficiantly and without regard for their own lives.

&RJunction deeper into Manor~
&R&CAs you enter this area of the Manor, you notice a definate chill in the air
you wonder what could possibly be causing this. With no answer available
you shrug it off as a breeze coming from an open window. Or at least thats what
you would like to believe.  You see another passageway leading off to the
north, directly into the chill.

the wall and discover a fine layer of frost!  Whatever could have caused this
you have no idea, and no wish to ever find out.

an inner sense of dread.  You see the mighty lord sitting upon his throne of

Being the adventurer that you are, always in the market for a good new scroll
you pick on up and blow the layer of dust off it. Just as you attempt
to recite this scroll a scrawny little lunatic comes dashing out from
behind a curtain and snatches it from your hands.  Hmm...Seems he wants
some sort of monetary compensation for it.
