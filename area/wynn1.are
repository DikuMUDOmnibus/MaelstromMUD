guard monk~
The Monk Guard~
A heavly muscled monk is guarding the gate.
~
Black marble eyes pierce your glaze, almost chilling you to the
bone.  The loose robes this man wears are unable to hide the
protruding muscles that proclaim his ability in battle.  It
takes all of your will power to remain standing.  You notice
that this man doesn't carry a weapon, then you realise that he
does not need one.

The Sensei~
A man floats in the air in a deep trance.
~
Waves of power radiate off this man.  You could swear that this man
could destroy you with just the flip of his wrist, but you don't
want to find out.  He wears simple robes that make him appear
to be nothing more than a common man... but it is plainly clear
that that is not true.

Top of the Western Tower~
As you reach the top of the stairs you are almost stunned by the

that you never have seen before.  Off to the west the sun is slowly sinking
behind a bank of clouds, causing the sky to be lit up in a spectacular array
of &Rreds &Ppurples &Yand &Bblues.
