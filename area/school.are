spider~
a spider~
A creepy hairy spider stands here suspiciously.
~
&YThis strange spider is almost as big as you are!  He is what we call a
&PMOB&Y.  Whenever you encounter an unknown creature, you should ALWAYS type
&Pcon <mob name>&Y to see if you are capable of killing it.  CON is short
for consider, which you can find more about by typing &Phelp con&Y.  If you
are sure you can conquer it, type &Pkill spider&Y.

&YThis nasty looking gopher is a tough one to conquer!  He might even be
too difficult for you at this stage.  If your hit points get too low during
a fight, you can type &Pflee&Y to flee to another room.  If you want to flee
automatically when your hit points get to a certain amount, type &Pwimpy
<amount of hit points>&Y.  Typing &Pwimpy&Y by itself will set it to your
maximum hit points divided by five.  Then when your hit points reach your
wimpy amount, you will automatically flee.

&BWIZLIST & GETTING HELP:
&cTyping &z'&wwizlist&z'&c will show you a "reasonably current" list of the MUD's
immortal staff.  Generally when you wish to seek help on something you should
begin at the bottom of that list and work upward, since those at the top
positions are often busy with things and will generally take the longest to
answer your question.  Also know that most immortals are busy doing something
even if it may not be immediately appearant so if they don't answer right away
give them time.  And if you ask for their attention and get it, don't tell them
"just a sec" if it's something you could have taken care of before calling their
attention.  These are just general notes of "etiquette" in dealing with 
immortals.  They're happy to help you out if you give them the chance and don't 
disrespect them.

&BTHE MUD'S RULES:
&cThese are the rules of EOS.  For other matters, use commom sense.
&B
&z*&w foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on EoS, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.
&B
&z*&w sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion
&B
&z*&w your presence here is a privilige not a right
&B
&z*&w no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
&B
&z*&w no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.
&B
&z*&w cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
&B
&z*&w Absolutely NO summonsing any mobs to Bethaven, Ravenwood or Alor Raharo.  
  I do NOT wish newbies jeopardized.  There's plenty of room outside those 
  towns, use them.

&B
INVOKES ON ITEMS:
&cYou won't find many low level items with invokable spells on them, but just so
you're aware of their existance there are many items in the game that can be
"invoked" to produce a certain effect or spell.  An item may contain the spell
'fireshield' and if you invoke the item it casts that spell upon you or the
target you select.  These are primarily handy to the non-magical fighting
classes.
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
E

&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&BFIGHTING PLAYERS VS MOBS:
&c  For attacking normal mobs simply type &w'&Rkill <mob name>&w'&c to start a fight with
them or if you are a thief type 'bs <mob name>' once you have the backstab
skill.  If you want to attack an animated corpse (you'll know when you come
across one) or a player (when you &R_BOTH_ &care in PK clans) you type &w'&Rmurder
<player>&w'&c to attack.
  If a fight isn't going well for you and you're likely to die if you don't find
a quick escape you simply need to type &B'&wflee&B'&c until you escape.  You will lose
a little bit of experience in the process, but it's better to lose 10xp than
lose half of what xp you've gained towards leveling.  Btw..it's 1000xp per
level.  In some areas flee doesn't work though, such as Dragon Valley though.
  Also, there are numerous "aggressive" mobs in the game that will automatically
attack you the moment you enter the room regardless of wether you wished to
fight or not.  So be wary of exploring high level areas or new areas without
shielding yourself against possible attack.
&B
ALIASES - Use and Creation&w:
&WSyntax&w:&r alias [shortcut] [task]  &C(Creates or modifies an alias)
&WSyntax&w:&r alias [shortcut]         &C(Deletes that alias)
&c  Aliases are common to many muds, but aren't found in all.  Basically these
are exactly what they sound like.  They're shortcut commands to preform larger
tasks.  &C(&BEx&w:&c having a shortcut command of 'fire' for performing the task, "cast
'fireball'"&C)&c.  This mainly just saves you on time and typing.  How it works:
&CExample&w:&c
<prompt> alias clb cast 'lightning breath'
Alias 'clb' added.
<prompt> clb
Cast spell on whom?
<prompt> clb dragon
Your blast of lightning MUTILATES the dragon.

&cMany new players aren't sure how to communicate with others so I hope this helps
&POOC&w:&c      The general discussion channel..everyone sees it. Shortcut = ]
&RVent&w:&c     A form of OOC channel that isn't language censored.   All see it.
&CChat&w:&c     Role-playing channel..everyone sees it.  Shortcut = .
&RClantalk&w:&c ONLY those in your clan can see it.  Shortcut = cl
&CShout&w:&c    Everyone sees it, but it's an emergency channel, not a discussion one.
&CYell&w:&c     Everyone within the same AREA as you sees it.
&CSay&w:&c      Everyone in the same ROOM as you sees it.  Shortcut = '
&PEmote&w:&c    Everyone in the same ROOM sees it.  It's for actions not speaking.
&WTell&w:&c     ONLY the person you send it to sees it.  Tell <player> <message>
&cClass&w:&c    ONLY those of the same class as you see it.  Ie all thieves etc..
&GAuction&w:&c  Everyone sees it.  This is to sell items, not talk.
&GHero&w:&c     ONLY level 100+ characters see this, Champs & Imms.  Shortcut = -
&cMusic&w:&c    Everyone sees this.  It's for..whatever :)
&GQuestion&w:&c Everyone sees this.  Ask questions here or on OOC.
Btw..OOC stands for "out of character" and with emotes it is only for actions.
If you type "emote grins sheepishly" and your name is Arch others in the room
will see, "Arch grins sheepishly".

&BHELPFUL STARTING HINTS:
&cHere's a couple setting hints to get you started.  If you type "config" and
press enter you will see a list of "toggle" settings for your character.  A few
of these are as follows and as to how you might want them:
&w+&Rautoloot&w:&c Automatically take all equipment within a monster\player you have
           killed.  Handy at starting levels, but I'd suggest removing it after
           about level 10.
&w+&Rautoexit&w:&c Automatically lists available exits from rooms, except "door" exits.
&w+&Rautogold&w:&c Automatically take the money a creature had from it's corpse.
&w-&Ransi&w:&c     IF you don't have the ability to see color you want this off,
           otherwise leave it on and enjoy.
&w-&Rcombat&w:&c   This will take away seeing "you dodge.." "<mob> dodges...".  Reduces
           the spam a great deal.
&w+&Rkeep&w:&c     This keeps the MUD from autoputting in a new title for you each level
           so you can keep your own customized one.
&w-&Rfullname&w:&c This enables 'name completion' which allows you to be lazy and type
           only partial words.  To look at a salamander you might 'look sal' and
           it will take the first item\mob\player that begins with those letters
           it can find.
These are just to help you get started, but you're welcome to set them up as you
choose.  To set a "setting" like this you type: "config <+/-><setting>" so to
say set autoloot ON..you'd type "config +autoloot".
Another helpful feature of the mud is the PROMPT command.  Using it you can
customize your info prompt in color or appearance.  "help prompt" will show all
of the settings you can use, but here's a sample one that you can copy\paste in
the game for show:
&Cprompt [&&z%h&&c/&&z%H&&Bhp &&z%m&&c/&&z%M&&Bm &&w[%a][&&C%x&&wxp]:&&z
&cAssuming your a new character at level 1 this would look like:
&w[&z20&c/&z20&Bhp &z100&c/&z100&Bm &w[0][&C1000&wxp]:&z <whatever you type in game>
&C(The [0] is your alignment, which generally starts out at 0.)

&BHP, BLOOD, MANA & MOVEMENT:
&cAside from Str and it's like-statistics there is &CHP &c(Hit points), &CBlood &c(A
vampire's form of mana), &CMana &c(Amount of magical energy available) & &CMovement
&c(one's exhaution rating.).  These are fairly simple really:
&BHP&w:&c       It's in your prompt like 20/20hp.  This is lowered with each hit you
          take from a player or monster.  If it reaches below 1hp you die and
          you must get your stuff back from your corpse.
&BBlood&w:&c    If you're not a vampire don't worry about this.  Vampires use "blood"
          instead of "mana" that they can't regain via potions, but "feed" off
          victims to replenish it.
&BMana&w:&c     The amount of magical energy available to you.  So when a spell costs
          say..50ma (ma = mana) then if you have 1500/1500ma you go to
          1450/1500ma.  Potions will revitalize this somewhat though.
&BMovement&w:&c This of course is the MV stat and lowers as you move between rooms,
          but it's rare that you ever run out of movement.  Usually people just
          ignore it completely.
&cI'd suggest you &w-&Calways&w-&c train HP.  You'll have enough mana with potions,
movement wears down slowly and blood can't be trained.

&BSTATISTICS:
&cThe statistics I'm referring to here are &CStr&c (Strength), &CInt&c (Intelligence),
&CWis&c (Wisdom), &CDex&c (Dexterity) & &CCon&c (Consitution).  What they do is:
&BSTR&w:&c Increases the amount of weight your character is able to carry, allows you
     to wield heavier weapons & increases your damage in battle.
&BINT&w:&c Allows you to practice skills\spells faster.  25 Int that only Mages and
     Necromancers are able to acheive allows you to become "adept" in a skill or
     spell in one practice.
&BWIS&w:&c Determines the amount of practices you receive per level.  Normally you
     can't pass 22 WIS unless you're a cleric, druid or psionisist which can
     reach 25 WIS.  22 WIS = 7 Practices per level.  25 WIS = 8 practices.
&BDEX&w:&c Dexterity determines how well you dodge out of the way or how quickly you
     are able to parry an attack so it doesn't reach you.  Most classes can only
     reach 22 DEX, except thieves, bards & vampires, which are able to reach
     25 DEX.
&BCON&w:&c The "life" statistic.  Constitution adjusts how much HP per level you gain.
     The higher your CON stat is the more you receive each level depending on
     your class.  Each class earns a different range of HP per level.  Only
     rangers and monks can pass the 22 CON limit with their 25 CON.
&BI very strongly encourage you to train your stats in this order&w:
&CWIS&c,&C CON&c,&C INT&c,&C STR&c,&C DEX  (Dex & Str can be switched though)
&cThis way you max your practices gained per level quicker so you can train other
things faster and after that you get your con up so you gain as much hp per
level as possible.
Generally you can't get a statistic past 22, except the one statistic that is
your class' "main" statistic.  These main statistics are as follows:
&z                _______________&z______________________________&z_
&z                | Statistic    &z| Classes that have it        &z|
&z                |--------------&z|-----------------------------&z|
&z                | &BStrength     &z|&C Warrior, Paladin & Werewolf &z|
&z                | &BIntelligence &z|&C Mage & Necromancer          &z|
&z                | &BWisdom       &z|&C Cleric, Druid & Psionisist  &z|
&z                | &BDexterity    &z|&C Thief, Vampire & Bard       &z|
&z                | &BConstitution &z|&C Ranger & Monk               &z|

&BPRACTICING & TRAINING:
&cOn this mud, unlike some other forms of MUDs, you must train your primary
statistics (Str, Int, Wis, Dex & Con), plus you may also train your HP, mana &
move.  To do training you use "practices" that you receive each level based on
your Wisdom.  The higher your Wisdom the more practices you're able to get per
level.  To train a stat, like Str, it costs 5 practices per train, but to train
HP, mana or movement it costs only 1 practice.  Note: You can't train a statisti
c like Str past 18 regardless of class.  To train a stat you simply type: 
&wtrain <item> &R#  &C(&R#&C is for how many practices to use.  Ie: train hp 50)
&cPracticing is a bit more indepth where training deals with statistics,
practicing is how you aquire new skills and spells.  It only takes one
practice to improve a skill or spell, but how much it is improved depends upon
your Int statistic.  Plus different classes can practice to different amounts
such as a Mage's 95% and a Thief's 85%.  To practice a skill\spell you type:
&wpractice <skill name>  &C(don't put ""s around the name if it's 2+ words)

Mudschool attracts many folks from the nearby towns because of its mystical
aura and simplicity.  Soothing feminine whispers float by you, being carried
away by the light breeze.

A Small Resting Site~
An old wooden bench occupies this clearing.  You can often find Shyan
relaxing here writing about her brave adventures.  A tiny streamlet runs
alongside, just enough to quench your thirst between battles.  Shyan is one
of the wisest Mentors at &WEye of the Storm II&c.  Ask her what it is you

As you travel south you will encounter more interesting creatures.  As
you conquer more and more mobs, you will soon advance to your next level. 
It is a good idea to head back to the training and practice rooms each time

three, you can increase statistics such as wisdom and constitution.

This is a rather small building branching off the main grounds.  This

simply run by a local citizen donating his time to the Mudschool.  Any money

This addition to the Fighting Grounds was created to help guide newcomers
in their quest of survival.  Underground, you will learn how to fight a mob,
make some money, find some equipment for yourself, and gain experience

the soil.  When you feel confident enough to fight in the main Fighting

Sounds of water splashing against the river bank fill your ears.  During
