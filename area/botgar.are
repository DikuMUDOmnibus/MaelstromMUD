Reception Area~
Wandering in from the temple, you find yourself in the reception area of
the Bethaven Botanical Garden.  The reception area is empty at the moment,
the sounds of the city outside supplying the only real interest.  Glancing
around, you notice numerous brochures scattered around the room.  Perhaps
looking at one may provide some knowledge of the garden.  There is a door
set into the southern wall here.

of the garden being closed to the public.  However, you do notice some
footprints on the floor, signifying some sort of activity.

notice something rather odd.  Towards the north, the garden seems to have
been turned into a cave of sorts.  Suddenly, you begin to wonder whether or

through your legs sending a shiver up your spine.

You trudge onward through the mud, growing weaker by the minute.  Between

garden, but rather, a jungle.  Your grip on your weapon becomes slippery,
and your body spasms with the sensation of hundreds of insects, but as you
look in horror, it is!  Not to mention the fact that the crunching, slurping
sounds seem to be a few feet away, through the mist.

Wandering in the darkness, you find yourself faced with the problem of a
dead end.  A loud creak shatters the silence as the ground below you caves
in!  You reach out in hope to grab a plank as you fall, but that too breaks.
The only sound now is the echo of your scream as you plummet into more
darkness.

Among The Trees~
As you climb into the trees, another huge fly shoots past your head.
Not far above, you see the reason.  Out of the corner of your eye, a sharp
jagged limb slowly draws back into the foliage.  You can continue further,
or retreat back down.

Above The Trees~
As you climb higher into the trees, the air around you suddenly grows
very warm.  It's almost as if the temperature were rising.  A loud hum
emanates from somewhere above, and you get the weird feeling that you are
being watched.

Top of the Trees~
As you break through the top of the trees branches, it is then that you
realize just how high you have climbed.  The garden below is nothing more
than a lush jungle, and you can just barely see the Oracle on the other side
of the city.  Bright beams of light shine from above, masking the gardens'
hidden horrors.  A huge platform is levitating above you.  It seems to be
the source of all the noise.  A closed trap door is right above you.

The Floating Platform~
You poke your head through the hatch just to get an idea of what this
thing is.  It looks to be a huge, magically powered disc, covered with
plants and grasses.  All around you the loud buzz of insects can be heard,
and to the northern edge of this disc, a small hut can be seen.

Some sort of door stands here to the north. It looks like the entrance to a
lair of some sort.

Lair of Insectus~
This hut is cluttered with various flasks, scrolls and spell formulae.
It looks comparatively normal, except for the many horrible looking specimen
jars!  Inside some jars, are what appear to be human/insect cross breeds,
animal/insect crosses, and many others.  The hairs on your neck rise up
suddenly, as you realize you are being watched!
