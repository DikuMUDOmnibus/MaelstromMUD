Sir Jonathon~
Sir Jonathon stands guard here.
~
Jonathon's stern rugged face reminds you of someone very loyal and law
abiding.  His clear grey eyes are small and set wide apart, and the fine
lines about them don't attempt to hide his age.  He has a kind smile, but
remains a serious stance as he continues to guard the west end of the
Castle.

Sir Dennis wears a rather amusing smile as he looks down upon you.  His

face.
