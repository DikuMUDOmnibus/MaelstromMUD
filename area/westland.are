You are standing on a long wooden dock, this is where the great ships
that sail the Western Sea tie up while they are loading supplies to take out
onto the many islands in the Western Sea.  A small wooden stairway leads down
the side of the dock to a much smaller one below.

A Deserted Beach~
On the shore of this beautiful beach, you see the almost white sand
stretching for miles in all directions.  There are strings of kelp that have
been washed up from each high tide, and the empty shells of all sorts of
marine life.  The waves lap gently up onto the sand, and roll back, meeting
the next one, fighting to run back to the sea.

A Deserted Beach~
The water splashes over your feet as the waves roll up the sand.  A
slight breeze springs up, bringing the warm air off the water, and the smell
of salty ocean to your nose.  A lone seagull cries his lonesome call, and
the sound of the waves lulls you into a sense of peace.

At the End of the Docks on the Main Land~
You are standing in a busy seaport.  There are many docks lining the
shore, with many large ships tied to them.  The smell of fish is nearly
unbarable, since the fishmongers gut there catch throw the remains into the
ocean.

At the End of the Docks on the Main Land~
You are standing in a small wharf, the reek of fish is nearly
overwhelming since the fishmongers merely toss their debris back into the
sea.  A long dock reaches out the west into the ocean, this is where the
ships are tied up to, while in port.

On the Rocky Shore of the Great Western Sea~
You are standing on a rocky shoreline, looking west you can see water as
far as the eye can see.  This is considered by many people to be the end of
land, although some of the more risky sailors claim that there are even
stranger places found across the seemingly endless body of water.

On the Beach of the Great Western Sea~
You are standing on a great sandy beach, the black greasy smoke

the hissing water and steam, from where the lava current flows into
the water.

You are standing on a secluded beach, the shoreline is free from
inhabitants due to the impassable mountainside to the east.  Great
billowing black clouds can be seen overhead coming from the far east
where Mount Cano continually erupts.
