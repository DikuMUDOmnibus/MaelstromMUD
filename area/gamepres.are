The Ancient Immortals Greetings.  I am the last of my kind.  The rest of
my brethren have all departed this universe and I shall soon follow.  We
were the creators of the Storm.  Our legacy is that which you see before you
as you walk these lands.  However, there is one last portion to this legacy
which is why I am the last to leave.  Within the lands you walk I have
buried artifacts created and used by myself and my brethren.  They hold
powers above and beyond those which you will find through normal means.  I
remained behind to bury these treasures, for only that which is hard won
holds great value.  If you seek power then JOIN in my quest and be forever
METAMORPHIZED.  Stormbringer, Last of the Ancient Immortals

Game Preserve Gates~
Before you lies the formidable entrance to the Game Preserve.  It is
comprised of two massive oak doors that are firmly bolted to a fence which
runs as far as the eye can see.  The fence itself is constructed of long oak
logs that have been crudely lashed together.  On top of these crudely joined
poles are carved four foot long spikes apparently intended to keep the
animals from escaping.  There is a sign attatched to the gate here.

You are in an open grass field.  The grass here isn't tall enough to
inhibit your view of the surround area.  Occasionally an animal will
approach you, their intent is unclear though.  A breeze causes the grass to

You leave the gate of the Game Preserve and wander cautiously into the

due to the high traffic rate of preserve Wardens.  All around you there is a
grass field that looks like a vast green ocean.  The breeze causes the
field's surface to sway to and fro, as if they were waves upon an ocean's
surface.

you notice animals grazing on the grass all about you.  The fence lies to

Though still within the tall grass, this area offers a break in the

underbrush is sparse, crowded out by the many trees.  There is heavy brush
to the south but otherwise travelling is easy in all other directions.  The

Forest Path~
The path comes to a gentle turn here to the west or the south.  The trees
huddle fairly closely together in this area.  You glance to the north and
notice the fence is running along to the east and west far before you.

Forest Path~
You wander down the dirt path at a regular pace.  The fence is fairly
close to the path here, you notice some strange makes across it's surface.
Birds can be heard from high above you.

fence~
You look at the fence a little more closely.  Brushing aside foliage you
examine the surface marks carefully.  They appear to be some type of rune
carved into the fence with an animal claw or crude dagger.  What could it
mean?

You move along the forest path, the fence is close to the north and
follows along the path.  Squirrels chitter at you from high in the trees.
You notice there is a nettle bush nearby.

While moving along the four foot wide forest path, you can see the fence
is visible beside you to the north.  Animals, or perhaps the wind, rustles
the undergrowth in the area around you.

Well Worn Path~
Suddenly the path widens out to about six feet.  The path itself is a
fine dirt as opposed to the soil of the previous path.  Absolutely no
vegetation grows on the worn path.  Trees overhang you providing a cool
shade from the sun during the day.

The worn path gradually curves its way to either the south or the west.
You move upon fine sand and tiny dust devils arise due to your passage.  You
notice there are some more strange markings on a tree nearby.

markings~
You push aside some foliage and carefully uncover the whole of the odd
markings they are apparently carved with an animal claw or crude weapon.
Unfortunately you can not read the writing or rune work.  A chill creeps
over you when you finish examining the rune-work.
~
E
dust~
Little tiny men with tan khaki pants run out from the side of the path
with brooms that are twice the size of them.  They quickly push sand up into
tiny clouds as you pass by.  Why they do this, or even if that is what dust
devils are, you're just not sure.

The forest path is thin and covered in a thin layer of dead leaves and

Yard of Hermit~
You wander into the yard of a small home.  Junk of all types litters the
ground here.  The house is kept up well and is most likely occupied.  You
dodge left and right to avoid one of hundreds, possibly thousands of ropes
hanging from the trees here.  A large oak door lies to your east.

junk~
Looking around at all of the junk, your mind nearly spins with the amount
of unidentifiable items lying about.  Odd constructs of metal, a large
wooden wheel with large flaps, bigs of this glossy black rope, and tons
more.

The door stands at roughly six feet in height.  The door itself is
covered in what appears to be thousands of claw marks and runes.  The door
sits at an angle in it's frame due to previous attempts to destroy it from
the outside.

House of Hermit~
Judging by the size of the house itself and the size of this room, you
imagine that this is the main room of what is likely to be a two room shack.
The room is dark due to the windows of the home being boarded over and
covered with cloth.  Small animals now dead are hanging from a low overhang
in the ceiling here.

The small animals seem to have undergone a form of salting.  What is
unusual is the fact that the animals are still currently whole.  Most often
salted meat is cut up first.

Bedroom of Hermit~
The room smells slightly of decay and dead grass.  The reason for this
seems to be the bed of grass that has been piled into the corner of this
room to serve as a bed.  The room is very spartan overall with the bed being
the most interesting object in the room.  An immense tome lies in the corner
of this room.

tome~
The tome is tightly bound in some sort of exotic animal skin.  There is a
small metal clasp that locks the book securely closed, you are unable to
open it and see what is written within.  Along the sides and spine of the
tome there are small blood stains.

ages ago.

with the muck and excrement though?

In a Small Thicket~
The thicket has a slight buzzing emitting from within, most likely a
colony of insects hard at work.  The soft grass which has been flattened by
the animals feels cool beneath your feet.  You may exit the thicket to the
west.
