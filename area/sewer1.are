A toffsman stands here poking through the garbage.

The toffsman is a poor sight.  Quite like the people who live down in the
Serf Village.  He is thin and wears raggedy clothing.  He has not seen a
shave since who knows when.  He does seem quite clean, however, regardless
of all the filth in the water.

Polly is quite extraordinary to look at!  Instead of hair on her head,
she has a headful of feathers.  The feathers continue down her neck and thin
from that point.  But her hands are very rough and very yellow in colour. 
Her mouth is almost like a beak because her top lip folds far down over her
bottom one.

Reba is rather scary looking at first.  Her nose sticks out just like
that of a rat and long whiskers stick out of her cheeks.  Her ears are
rather small, but rat-like and you notice that her hands also look like
rats-paws.  She's actually kind of cute in a way.  Out from behind her lies
a long pink rat-tail.
