Entrance to Goblin Outpost~
You arrive at the gate of a goblin outpost.  From what you can see from
the outside, this outpost seems pretty big.  As you approach the gate, you
notice what you thought was a wooden fence is actually a row of pikes with
skulls on them.  A closer look at the skulls tells you they are elven in
origin.  These goblins must be pretty organized for having built such an
outpost.  Maybe you should leave before they find you here?

Road of Training~
The road is littered with broken armor and weapons, you can see small
puddles of blood drying in a few spots.  Decidedly, these goblins don't take
too many precautions when training.  You can reach the eastern training
grounds by continuing east or go back to the main walkway be heading west.

Captain's Quarters~
After stopping to admire the tower before you, you hear faint voices
comming from below you.  You look down and notice you are standing on a
gratting.  It's pretty obvious that this is some kind of cell to keep
prisoners.  A little off north is the entrance to the tower, while you can
just barely see the southern gate from here.

without a light.  There is a small trail in the dirt floor which leads to
the rooms only object.  A ladder in the back of the room leads to the upper
level of the tower.  You can exit the tower out the southern door.

Four Way Intersection~
As soon as you enter the tower, you are faced with choosing a direction
as the hallway splits in all directions.  From what you can see by looking
east and west, there must be some kind of watchpoint in those directions.
To the south the walkway continues on.  The exit to the tower is directly to
the north.
