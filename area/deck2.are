Hall of Rangers~
You are in the Hall of Rangers deap within the Ranger Sanctuary.  The
only difference from the suronding woods is a sense of power and a complete
peace that washes away all trouble.  Giant oaks define the perimeter of the
hall, magestic giants of the forest.  No matter what season the turf is
green, the air cool and freash.  A circle of stone chairs stands in the
middle of the hall each facing one of the cardinal directions.  In the
middle of them a strange black stone, it is the only thing out of place.

A fountain in the woods~
You are under the canapie of the forest, oaks stand on all sides of you.
A strange and beutifull crystal fountain is here.  It shines from some inner
light, showering the surronding woods with a beutifull splash of magical
colors ripleing across the spectrum in an unending dance.

A quite corner of the woods~
A single oak dominates here, with a shining stone embeaded into its
trunk.  A complete lack of sounds from the surronding world indicates the
power of the stone.

In the forest~
The sights, the sounds, and the smell of the forest surrond you.  The
magestic oaks ripple off unendingly to your sight in all directions.  The
over grown remains of a foundation are here.  In the center of it a stone
arch stands undamaged and unweathered.  Aparently impervious to the ravages
of time.

In the forest~
You are in a small clearing, where an oak had fallen and broke the canape
letting in some light.  In the middle of the clearing a wood alter has been
carved into the fallen tree.  Set into the top of the alter is a small white
saphire.  It's strange cut defies the eyes, as if there is an infant number
of facades.
