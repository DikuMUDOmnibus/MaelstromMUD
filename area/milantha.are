forest pixie~
A forest pixie~
A forest pixie blinks at you in wonder.
~
You see an exotic, tiny little woman in front of you.  Her hair is blonde
and very long, and is pulled on top of her head with an ornamental comb. 
Her tiny little form is perfectly shaped, and magic oozes out of every pore
of her body.

satyr~
A Satyr~
A Satyr gazes at you with pure lust in his eyes.
~
The Satyr looks at you, and you can tell by the look that he's wondering
what you look like in your skivvies.  You feel really uncomfortable, for you
know that the Satyr is not very distinguishing in its tastes.  His infamy
for lecherousness precedes him.  You'd better get out while the going's
good.

nymph~
A pretty nymph~
A pretty nymph gazes at you from hooded eyes.
~
Two things really strike you about this woman.  The first is her
incredible beauty.  The second is that she has green skin.  Guardian
of the trees, this Nymph lives only so long as the tree in which
her spirit shelters remains alive.  She is also known for her incredible
appetite for cute young men.

packrat~
A packrat~
The packrat scurries around looking for bright green objects.
~
The packrat is an odd sort of fellow.  He has a long, rat-like nose
and long scraggly hair.  His ears poke out, and he walks around with
a stoop.  It would be advisable not to mess with him, however.  His
yellowed teeth look like they could make nasty holes.

The Mother Crow stares at you suspiciously!
~
This large black bird could be an opponent to reckon with.  However, the
mother crow is not quite sure if you are an intruder or just one of her
young.  Size-wise, you can certainly pass for one of these gigantic crow
chicklets.

~
This Elf is very occupied with the wind ceremony. He does not really notice
your presence. All his thoughts and energy are focused on the ritual. 
He seems to be talking to someone or something, but you cannot understand
the words or see anyone around. It must be some sort of prayer he is 
reciting.

A Woodpecker~
A Woodpecker is making an awful pecking noise...
~
This bird would be your average non-descript woodpecker.  However, as
most things on this tree, it has grown to gigantic size.  Almost four times
as big as those woodpeckers you have seen in other regions of the realm.  It
seems, that this woodpecker is also not afraid of you at all.  In fact, it
looks like it may consider to bang his sharp beak on your head instead of
the branch you are standing on.

nagging thought out of your head.  Too many people have permanently fallen
asleep in magical forests.  You don't want to be the next.

Lookout Tower~
From the top of this tower, you can see the entire enchanted forest and
the valley beyond.  The panoramic view is spectacular and frightening.  The
sense of vertigo overcomes you, and you clutch the railing for dear life. 
The guards seem to be taking undue notice of you.  You'd better leave...

You climb higher up into the tree.  It is becoming ever more apparent
that humanoid creatures live in this tree.  Every now and then, you see a
strip of bright fabric tied around a branch, and an occasional bauble left
on the tree branch.  By the design of these items, you believe these
creatures to be some kind of elf.

The tree branch ends here, but there is a rope ladder leading upward. 
Not just any rope, the tree elves carefully select fibers for their ropes. 
It is said that not even the sharpest axe blade can cut through these
special supports, and the secret of making the ropes is a well-guarded
trust.

Elven Meeting Hall~
Some of the younger members of the council can be seen here in this
corner.  The meetings of the council can become too tedious, even for elves.
They are quietly talking and playing a game of Ak-hal, a strategy game
similar to chess.

Elven Meeting Hall~
In contrast to the rest of the elven surroundings, the meeting hall is
very stark and simple.  Clearly, functionality was the most important idea
in designing this area.  A few sturdy chairs can be seen along the perimeter
of the building.

Elven Meeting Hall~
Council members can be seen split up into small groups here, quietly
chatting in the soft silvan tongue.  Their fierce faces are like stone, but
they cannot hide the softness and joy that is ever-present in their eyes. 
The dimly lit room makes it hard to see the size and other features about
it.

Elven Tent~
As you enter this tent, you notice that it is very spartan in appearance.
Only the necessities are present, and nothing not originating in nature can
be found.  Several tent flaps have been left open, allowing the fresh
breezes from the forest to waft in.

Elven Tent~
The sleeping area of this elf looks particularly uncomfortable.  Not even
the typical woven grass mats of most elves can be found in these quarters. 
Only the interwoven tree branches support his weight.  The walls, too, are
devoid of any adornment.  Only the silk of the tent wall itself provides any
decoration.

Elven Tent~
Gone, too, from this tent are the many games which tend to occupy the
minds of elves.  Apparently, this tent owner believes there are more
important things than games to occupy the mind.  At least in this area there
are woven mats to sit on.  The branches look mighty uncomfortable.

Elven Tent~
The fare which is spread out upon the ground is very meager.  Only a
glass of clear cool water, and a piece of hard wayfairer bread is available.
By the looks of things, it looks like they have been here for a long while. 
You wonder what deep thoughts much occupy the mind of this elven owner.

Inside the Tree~
Total darkness and nothingness is what you have entered into, a void. 
There is nothing here to make you want to come here again.  Or to enter any
further.  Wait...  There seems to be a sound coming from further west of
you.  But you can't see the source of the sound.

Inside the Tree~
This is the termite's hideout.  Or rather its progress.  This hole here
clearly is only its handiwork on display.  You wonder how much further it
can go on before the whole tree is eaten away.  Holes are prevalent inside
showing you that things are not as they seem on the outside and this
certainly holds true for this tree.

Elven Tent~
When you enter this tent, you are immediately struck by the incredible
oppulence displayed throughout.  Above your head you can hear the soft
tinkling of a magically powered wind chime.  The floors are covered with
soft silken pillows, and intricate wallhangings cover the otherwise drab
walls of the tent.

Elven Tent~
Here in the sleeping quarters, you again notice the unusual amount of
pampering provided by the owner.  Instead of the usual woven grass mats,
this elf has an elevated bed which is stuffed with sweet, dried grasses. 
You marvel at the simple yet elegant beauty of this tent.  It is like a
melding of the natural and elven-made.

Elven Tent~
All manner of strategy games and manner of peaceful entertainment can be
found in this corner of the tent.  Some sort of magickal device provides a
soft, lilting tune which sounds like a flute.  The pillows and soft floor
covering seem especially inviting, and you consider taking a rest here.
