Atop the Trees~
You have arrived at the top of the trees, and have discovered wooden bridges
leading to the north, where incredibly large trees are.  You take a look
around you, never being this high in your life, and realize that you seem to
have gone into another dimension, for the sky is no longer the blue you are
used to.  It has changed to purple!  The only exits are north, or back down
this immense tree, into the foggy haze.

to be there.  The sky is rapidly changing colours, the clouds zooming by at

popping up all over the place, and immediately polymorphing into something
new.

out of marble and have been polished to shine.  Many torches line the walls,
making the marble reflect brilliantly.  At your feet is a long red carpet

Hall of Hatred~
You stand in the entrance of the dreaded caves known as the Halls of
Hatred.  Named so by the man who dwells in the caves, the very walls emanate
hatred.  The emotions are so strong that even the strongest men will fall if
they dwell in the caves for too long.  The cave walls glow a dull red, and
the only sound you can hear is the sound of someone grunting..
