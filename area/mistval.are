&wYou see before you a man of small stature who is at obvious peace with
himself and his karma.  He sits cross legged but as you approach he gets up
and speaks to you in a serene manner.  He is wearing a beaded wooden
necklace and is tonsured and shaved clean.  His shaved head gleams
mysteriously.  You wonder how such a small man could defend himself
especially in these dangerous parts.  But then you remember that these monks
can conquer others through sheer will and mind over matter.  He shows no
fear of you and is almost oblivious to anything but the harmony of himself
and his environment.

Entrance to Lairich Valley of Mist~
&r============================================================================
&wYou have reached an impasse in the road where a thick &zmist &wlike a wall
&wpermeates the view ahead of you preventing you from seeing any further.
Your heartbeat quickens but is it with excitment or &Rfear&w? You feel
an almost tangible pull as the silence seems to almost sing you towards it
and beguile your senses and paralyze your will. There is a sign rooted in
front of you barely noticeable through the thick blanket of uncertainty.

&wYou have decided to test your mettle and brave the unknown. You feel the
&Bchill &wseep into your bones grasping your very soul with its icy touch.
You have only walked ten paces but you feel a weariness like a heavy weight
as though you have been travelling for days. You shiver involuntarily.
You can see that the path continues further north.

&wAs you travel into the east, you can hear the singing almost vibrating through
the mist. You can catch the sound of laughter echoing in a chilling manner.
The laughter sounds very deranged. You know going east will bring you closer 
to the source. The road has foot prints embedded in them.

&wAs you trudge heavily through the dense unknown, you can feel the silence
but it seems to exude a presence that makes you fear for your unprotected
back and as time loses all meaning in this valley, you lose touch with
reality.  You walk on as though in a trance.  You can make out a small path
to the east.

&wThe mist continues to block your vision and you know you have to rely
heavily on your sense of survival and your intuition.  Your antennae goes off
crazily as you progress further into the mist.  The sounds of laughter are
all around.  It echoes eerily hurting your ears.

Thick Mist~
&p^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&zThe mist has gotten thicker to a point where your body struggles against
it like it was weight. You can see many trees around you but they look
menacing and dead at the same time. You see the trail break into east and
west and to the north it continues still. But as yet you can see not where it
heads.

until you were directly upon it. You look in and you see many skeletal remains
of what appear to be humans and other poor adventurers. There are flowers 
of the brightest hues strewn all around in contrast to the morbid site as if
someone had recently paid it a visit. There seems to be a path to the north.
Only you can't be too sure of anything in this mist.

Before a Hill~
&O^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&wYou stand before the base of a hill.  You look up but see mist surrounding
your vision and thus cannot see where the hill leads or when it ends.  There
is a barren road that leads up and disappears into the mist.

Between Two Tall Trees~
&O^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&wYou carefully tread up through the mist and you have ended up here.  You
find yorself standing between two trees of enormous circumference making an
arch around you although you can't discern how tall they really are you can
see from their roots that they are pretty tall.

On the Hill~
&O^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&wThe hill is gently sloped and has a lot of lush &ggrass &wand many trees
that you can barely make out in the mist.  The trail continues north and
then to the south.  You can hear water trickling distantly but can't tell
its source.

Before a Dark and Dimly lit House~
&z======================================================================
&wYou stand before a dark and &zdimly &wlit house with &rdark red &wtiles
for the roof and all around are prickly rose bushes with no roses in bloom. 
The house seems unoccupied although there are many windows with lights
coming feebly from them.

 &wYou stand in the foyer of the dark house with feeble lights coming from
the windows when you saw it from the outside.  The walls are bare except for
candles hanging from black candle holders fastened to the walls every 2
feet.  The wooden floor makes your footsteps sound amplified to you.  The
hall continues to the north.  &z

dark candles burn dimly in rows hanging from black candle holders. The hall
continues to the north towards some unseen destination. But the mist as 
always, obscures your sight past that few feet.

Upon close examination you see that the thorns have clutching in their deadly
embrace, pieces of rotted flesh and bits of clothing and hair. The mist hangs
in deceiving mellowness. You can see that the neat cobble stone road continues
south along with the splendor of the rose bushes and the virulence of the 
thorns.

Incubus' Hideout~
&z========================================================================
&wThis is the room where lurks an evil force that the devil himself has sent
to this world as a manifestation of his evil wishes. The room is dark with
hardly any light of any remote source present. There is a metal fireplace
that is closed in the center with the smell of something burning coming out
in unpleasant waves of smoke. The bed in the room is blood stained and a 
bloody basin sits beneath the bed. There is a jewelry box filled with many
gems and trinkets that were taken as souvenirs from whoever dwells in this
unholy house.

to the &rs&pt&Ba&Pi&Rn&Ye&Gd &wglass window that seems to be the entrance. From the window at

can almost hear a lilting voice but you couldn't be sure. At this point it

all around her. And the room is silent except for her humming.

your nostrils are assailed with the smell of putrifaction and doom.  Some of
the skeletons are dismembered and some still wear their earthly possesions
on their bodies.  The lovely smell of the flowers mixed in with the smell of
decay reeks of sweet rot.  You imagine the pits of hell smelling like this.

with resources available in this area.  There is a straw mat in the corner

You can hear strange cries coming from the cave only it is hard to see from
where since the mist hasn't let up a bit. Only when you look up do you see
that they are coming from strange looking mutated bats with snake heads.

Falling into the Pit~
&O|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
&wYou are falling down a pit where you saw the skeletons earlier.  You did
not realize that the pit was so deep.  When you saw it from above it seemed
to be a shallow pit.  You steel yourself for a nasty fall.

Inside a Dark Cave~
&z-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
&wYou continue down the tunnel. The mutated snake-bats start fluttering all
around angrily at your entrance. They drop caustic venom on you and screech 
in their shrill high pitched voice making you wince. You see that the tunnel
extends further south and north.

Zazu's Pit~
&r=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
&RThe area you have entered in the cave is a pit littered with remains of
many poor souls. It glows with an intense red light that emanates from some
unknown source. Not only is it an intense red that bathes your body in a 
bloody light, it is scorching hot as it burns into your skin.

Before a Large Hollow Tree~
&g=========================================================================-
 = &wThe tree you stand before is immense as to boggle you.  Not so much in
height but in circumference.  It must have been a beautiful tree tree full
of life and a home for many animals of the jungle.  Now it is just a tree a
mere skeleton of what it used to be.  There seems to be an arch leading into
the tree.  You can't be sure but there seems to be a room inside the tree.

misty in here. But what dazzles you and catches your eyes is the fact that 
you have tumbled upon a veritable treasure room. &YGold and &wsilver &Yc&wo&Yi&wn&Ys &Olie all
around for the taking. And &pjewels &Oof all sizes and shapes and descriptions
gleam amidst all the coins.

&wThe room which you have entered is that of a veteran in these parts. There
are many trophies of wild animal heads hung proudly on the wall and many
weapons handcrafted by someone with vast knowledge of weapon making hangs on
the opposite wall. A crude oil lamp burns here seemingly out of place but
you are nevertheless grateful for even some warmth and light in this forsaken
place. There appears to be a trap door hidden by the dirt on the ground.

The Temple ~
&G &Y==&G=================================================================&Y==
&BThe path has led you to a mountain top where the air is crisp and the
serenity prevelant. You are in a temple of Buddha. The temple is supported
by columns that are carved and painted in bright splashes of &Ggreen &Rred &Bblue
and &Yyellow. &BIn the front of the hallway sits a &Ygolden &Btwenty foot
statue of Buddha. All around the smell of sweet smelling aromatic woods
burning on a small brazier fills the air. The sounds of bells and chanting 
are all around. You feel peace here.

Ante Chamber of Adoration~
&R==========================================================================
&WLove fills the air. It smothers you in its intense embrace. All those insane
acts you have done in the name of love come to mind. You want to fight the
inner demons that drive you to commit crimes of passion. In this room is where
you may come to terms with that raging hell called adoration, love.

The Frost Queen's Throne Room~
&C==========================&Y000000000000000000000&C==========================
&wWhen you enter this room, you have to shade your eyes due to the intense
brightness that emanates from it.  It glows intently with all the powers
and wonders of the Frost Kingdom.  There is a white carpet leading up to
a magnificent throne made of diamonds and the rarest gems.  Seated
majestically upon her throne is the Frost Queen.
