Ice Devil~
An Ice Devil~
An ice devil flies above you mocking your bad fortune.
~
The Ice Devil is Satan's cold variety of the common demon. The Lord of
Darkness has created this species to extend his rule into the arctic areas
of Storm where other demons way perish due to the lack of fire.
The Ice Devil is not really aggressive, but his constant mocking is really
getting to you...

&BClan Skill\Spell Guidelines:
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&cThis I pretty much leave to you, hoping you'll find something creative that
supports your clan theme, but I feel there need be a couple pointers on what
type of skill\spell not to choose:
&c
&z1..&w>&c I'd like not to see skills that are built off of a spell\skill that is the
     basis for damage of a particular class.  Skills like backstab for thieves
     or multiburst\spellcraft for mages.  To give these to all your clan members
     hurts the class the ability comes from in fights.  Makes them less useful
     in groups as well.  Think of it this way..don't use the best to skills of
     any one class.  Like a mage's spellcraft & multiburst, or a cleric's
     dispel magic & dancing lights, a warrior's enhanced damage two and berserk.
&z2..&w>&c I'd also like not to see skills that help only one or two classes UNLESS
     your clan is based around that one or two classes.  Like a skill that in
     truth only helped thieves, I'd rather not see unless your clan is one of
     purely thieves.
&c
These are all I'm going to limit on them and that only so we don't get skills
that either take away power from a particular class or only help one class of
your clan.  Aside from those..think up original stuff and check with me, Lacey,
and Thalador.

&BClan Raids:
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&BRules regarding Deities defending their HQ:
  &z1.&W>&c Deities may ONLY attack those mortals within their HQ, not those just
      outside.
  &z2.&W>&c Deities cannot do anything a mortal cannot.  This means that the use of
      immortal commands (force, goto..etc..) is ILLEGAL.
  &z3.&W>&c You're free to use only spells or equipment accessible to mortals.  Please
      do NOT use items from a proto area that isn't still stuck on 2222.  Also
      use only your own clan skill incase any of you Deities get 'mset'.
  &z4.&W>&c The use of area attack spells such as 'psychic quake', 'gas breath' or
      'ultrablast' are probited due to their damage being based in hp and your
      ability to have 30k hp.  You'd simply kill them in one shot w/multiburst.

&BGuidelines for Non-Guardian Clan Mobs:
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&BTypes of Mobs: &cHealer, Blacksmith, Banker, Vampire Feed Mob, Baker, Secretaries,
               EQ dispensers, Potion Sellers, Trade-In Mob, General Store &
               other misc. mobs.
Many of the types listed above can be joined btw.  You don't have to have a
seperate store for clan potions and containers or a seperate mob for doing the
trade-in process or the EQ dispensing process.  Those are listed just incase you
wish to spread them out.  Guidelines for most mobs should be the same.
  Level &w=&r 100
  &cHP & Shields &w=&r Set by Grunt's Mob Creation Book
&cThe only exception to this is the Vampire Feed Mobs.  I'd like those to have an
HP amount of 300,000 and be level 1.  Also add a mobprog to them like this:
&cMobprog Type  &w=&r speech_prog
&cProg Argument &w=&r "quit" (Whatever you wish really, but have it in the room desc.)
&cProg Commands &w=&r
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&rif isclan($n) == <&GYour clan number, check 'clans'&r>
  emote shoves you away roughly screaming to be left alone.
  mptransfer $n <A room bordering the mob>
endif
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&cAlso please add this prog to Vampire Feed mobs as well:
&cMobprog type  &w=&r rand_prog
&cProg Argument &w=&r 50
&cProg Commands &w=&r c 'complete heal' self
&c
These are for your member's convience.  The rest I leave to you.

&citem vnum        &w= &r2159
&cclan's ID #      &w= &r2

  say That should fix it.
else
  say Why thank you for returning this object that is obviously not yours.
  mpjunk helm
  say Now, do yourself a favor and get the hell out of this clan's home.
endif
&C--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&cFeel free to add in\change emotes and says as you wish, those in are purely for
example.  With this form of program the only times a member will need to be
given a new "champ" item will be when they're first inducted, die and lose their
corpse or are PK'd and plooted.  But this is only for the "champion lv100" item
and the "lv65/75" item.

&BClan Guardian Mob Guidelines:
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&zGATEGUARDS:
&C-----------
&cInstead of 3 gatekeepers, we've decided to leave it at 1 gatekeeper.  Basically
I'm looking for a cross between the Dragon King w/dispel magic and a champion on
a major PCP high.  He can't use 'shatter' or 'molecular unbinding' though, nor
is he allowed to load himself as a death_prog.  Here's what I'd like to see:
&clevel   &w=&r 106 (This'll keep death field off your guard)
&cHP      &w=&r 30,000hp
&cShields &w=&r As many as you can pile on w/o using progs to add 'blade barrier' or
          'field of decay'.
&cOther than that, have a blast..you're limited to 1 and I want him hard as can
be, but still passable for a couple champs.  With 3 before we'd likely have
almost no one raiding..it just wouldn't be worth it.
&c
&BEquipment for GATEKEEPER guardians:
&cGuardians may wear any of your clan equipment and in addition may dual wield a
lv100 -piercing- weapon that you create.  The flags for the weapon are set as
this:
&clevel       &w=&r 100
&cExtra       &w=&r no_damage, nolocate, inventory, poisoned, chaotic & flame.
&ctake        &w=&r take & wield
&caddaffects  &w=&r hitroll +20 & damroll +20
&cattack type &w=&r piercing
&b
&zWANDERING CLAN GUARDIANS:
&C-------------------------
&cWandering clan guardians are built in the exact same way, except for the
following changes:
&cYou may have 1 wandering guardian per 10 rooms in your HQ that are USED.  Not
empty.  1 per 10 rooms rounded up.
&clevel &w=&C (Peaceful 104)&R -<PK 100>-

alignment you claim your clan is.  Neutral aligned clans shall consider
themselves as good aligned clans in this list.

&cI want evil clans exiting to Bethaven as well simply because of the numerous
things built around that town.  Bethaven is the mud's heart in truth for now so
it shouldn't be cut off from those of evil alignment.  Your clan members should
be allowed easy access to the donation rooms, class noteboard, etc...  That and
Bethaven itself isn't really a "good" aligned city, with thugs and vagabonds
roaming it's streets freely.

&BGeneral Guidelines on Clan EQ:  (not potions, pills & scrolls)
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&z1..&W>&c Clan EQ can't be a weapon or body armor.
&z2..&W>&c Clan EQ can't be an item that can be worn twice upon a character. (ie neck,
     finger, wrist, orbit & ankle)
&z3..&W>&c Clan EQ should be cost: 0...it's not supposed to be sold.
&z4..&W>&c If you're an evil clan, it's in your own best interests to make clan eq
     anti-good..and vice versa for a good clan.  Incase you're plooted.
&z5..&W>&c Clan EQ should be 'nodamage'.
&z6..&W>&c Clan EQ should have a keyword of the clan in it's name.  (ie Elysium..etc.)
&z7..&W>&c Clan EQ shouldn't have these flags: nodrop & noremove.  This only harms
     your own members since it's them that use those items the most.
&z8..&W>&c On addaffects for clan EQ:
  &ra.&W)&c Hitroll & Damroll will be considered as one addaffect together.
  &rb.&W)&c Mana & Blood will be considered as one addaffect together and I'd like to
      see those two on every piece, except a clan that doesn't induct
      spellcasters.
  &rc.&W)&c You can bunch addaffects like saving-spell and saving-breath to get -30
      saving-spell OR saving-breath if you wish, but together they still count
      as 2 addaffects since you get the advantage of both.  I'd like to keep
      this bunching down to 2 types at a time and none bunching with damroll.
&c
HQ rules aren't set in stone, so please if you wish to do something different
speak to me.  I'll very likely let you do what you wish as long as it's
reasonable.  And if I won't allow a particular change it's with good reason.
These guidelines to follow were set simply to give some base guidelines to start
from.  They don't tell you how to "dress the stage", but merely how I wish the
"nails to be hammered in".  Anyone who has questions about any of the guidelines
please don't hesitate to speak to me.

&BDeity Guidelines:
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&z1..&W>&c Deities are NOT to enter the HQ of another clan w/o the express permission
     of that clan's deity or one of it's officers.  There have been several
     fights over people doing this.  Consider it common courtesy.  You don't
     want people invading your home, don't invade theirs.
&z2..&W>&c If you find one of your members breaking a rule, don't cover for him, turn
     him in otherwise you'll find yourself paying for the same problem if you
     knew.  Some "favoritism" is allowed, being their mortals in your cult who
     "worship" you, but only within the boundries of what's legal.
&z3..&W>&c Problems between deities are to be settled amoung the ranks of imms.  If
     you have a serious problem with another Deity you feel you cannot solve
     then speak with me.  I'm not going to put up with "catfights" over public
     channels or even semi-public channels.  To roleplay that two PK deities
     hate one another is all well and good, but remember, this IS a game and you
     should be making an effort to work together when out of character.  When
     immortals start carrying their fights over to public channels you make us
     all look bad and for usually very little reason.  Once again..if you have a
     problem you need solved, bring it up with me.
&c
These are all I'm asking for now and I feel every one of them is justified and
is listed because there have been numerous problems in those fields.  I hope you
remember that regardless of my "personal view/feelings" towards you it has no
weight in how I view your performance as a Deity.  Some of you should know this
quite well.  So please don't keep a problem to yourself because you feel I don't
like you.  Truth is, you can hate me all you want, just as long as you do your
job and keep it between us so as not to cause public problems.  Make sense?

   either Bethaven or Hammerheim.
5) No portals leading out of the HQs are allowed.
6) No blood, hp or mana fountains are allowed in HQs.
7) No Clan equipment under level 30 is allowed.

9) Shops, Smithy, Bank, Bloodmob, Water fountains, Healers, Trainers,
   Libraries, Offices for the leaders, Donation boxes, etc are all allowed
   in the HQs.
10) Leveling Mobs or armor/weapon items that can only be obtained in the
    HQs are STRICTLY prohibited!

Arctic Wasteland~
&WFrozen fields for miles on end.  No one can survive in this weather.
You wonder how you made it this far.  The barren trees seem to howl along
with the merciless cold wind.  The bleak trail continues east and west.  Or
so it seems.

Arctic Wasteland~
&WYou are walking on what seems to be a frozen lake.  The blinding cold
wind hasn't let up and doesnt seem to want to let up any time soon.  All
around the blizzard does the dance of winter reveling in its cold embrace.
The lake continues in all directions.

There is a huge iceburg up ahead blocking passage any further in any
direction but north.
