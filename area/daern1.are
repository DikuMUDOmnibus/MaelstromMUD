A Landing in the Attic~
The attic is very grim and dark, and a musty smell looms through the air. You
look around to find no sconces, candles, or torches anywhere. To the west
and south, you can see many compartments used for storing various household
treasures, trash and what have you.

Servant's Passage~
This passage is simple, and is a fair size to allow the servants to come
through with their serving trays and carts. A strange rope hangs above you on
some sort of pulley and goes down into the floor in the north.
