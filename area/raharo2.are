weiyrna innkeeper raharo searnia~
Weiyrna~
Weiyrna, the local innkeeper, stands here cleaning a mug out.
~
Beaming back at you with a cheerful face, this aging lady walks in your
direction, absent-mindedly dry-washing her hands with her apron.  Taking a
second to blow a whisp of greying hair from her face, Weiyrna curties
formally for you, asking you how may she be of service.

Assair~
Assair, sorcerer of the arcane arts, stands here.
~
Rich purple robes cloak this man flowing all about him to surround his
feet in a pool of fabric on the ground.  Crystal blue eyes regard you
curiously from beneath a shaggy wealth of grey hair.  Turning away from you
for a moment, he whispers a few words with his hand hovering over a small
object that looks like some form of pill as a blue aura surrounds the
object.

blais armourer raharo searnia~
Blais~
Blais, the local armourer, stands here polishing a breastplate.
~
Setting down his latest piece of work, he reaches out to shake your hand
in greeting and you notice just how much work in this forge has increased
his strength as his arm retracts.  Cloaked in a simple leather vest, pair of
pants and wrapped about in a hole-filled apron, he can even now give an air
of knowing how to defend himself.

eldvain baker raharo searnia~
Eldvain~
Eldvain stands here rolling out a pile of dough.
~
As you glance at the local baker, he looks up from his work to raise an
eyebrow slightly in question.  Even as his eyes lock on your's, his hands
keep working at the dough before him professionally, without needing to even
watch his creation.  A large white apron is tied about his heavy bulk,
covering the local garb common to most citizens in dried up dough and caked
on flour.

Absently brushing aside the greying handles of his mustache, Brear turns
his face towards you with mild curiousity.  Grey hair cloaks the top of his
head, highlighting his crystal blue eyes, the common trait of those in this
realm.

Gladeral~
Gladeral, master in the crafting of blades, stands here.
~
Hard blue eyes stare back into your's searching your soul with their
penatrating gaze as he takes in your appearance, mentally accessing your
skill in using your weapons.  A slight nod from his head seems the only
indication of his acknowledgement of your experience or in the promise you
hold.  Long black hair extends backwards behind his head into a tight tail
at the nape of his neck that trails down the middle of his back.

The local jewelry appraiser, Aleis, stands here.
~
Seems not to have even truely noticed your existance yet as she studies a
small sapphire gem in her hand through a glass eye-piece.  Raven black hair
spills down across her shoulders, giving her a matching look to the majority
of the rest of the Alor Raharo citizens you've seen so far.

~
Whispy white hair hangs loose around the sides of this balding man.  His
blue eyes sparkle with interest at a new customer as you enter as he
carefully marks a place in a black ledger of accounts before looking up to
greet you.  Judging by the ink stains on the sleeves of his clothing and at
the tip of his nose you wonder begin to wonder just how much time this man
spends around his records.

Nemari~
Nemari, feeding one of the store's puppies, tends shop here.
~
Craddling a puppy in the nook of one arm, while another gently feeds it,
Nemari seems almost totally lost in her work, barely glancing up at your
enterance as you peruse the various cages within the shop.  The small puppy
stubbornly fights her attention, trying to bury it's nose beneath her long
glistening black hair, whimpering softly to itself.

&BWIZLIST & GETTING HELP:
&cTyping &z'&wwizlist&z'&c will show you a "reasonably current" list of the MUD's
immortal staff.  Generally when you wish to seek help on something you should
begin at the bottom of that list and work upward, since those at the top
positions are often busy with things and will generally take the longest to
answer your question.  Also know that most immortals are busy doing something
even if it may not be immediately appearant so if they don't answer right away
give them time.  And if you ask for their attention and get it, don't tell them
"just a sec" if it's something you could have taken care of before calling their
attention.  These are just general notes of "etiquette" in dealing with 
immortals.  They're happy to help you out if you give them the chance and don't 
disrespect them.
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&BTHE MUD'S RULES:
&cThese are the rules of EOS.  For other matters, use commom sense.
&B
&z*&w foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on EoS, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.
&B
&z*&w sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion
&B
&z*&w your presence here is a privilige not a right
&B
&z*&w no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
&B
&z*&w no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.
&B
&z*&w cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
&B
&z*&w Absolutely NO summonsing any mobs to Bethaven, Ravenwood or Alor Raharo.  
  I do NOT wish newbies jeopardized.  There's plenty of room outside those 
  towns, use them.

&CFeet
&z*  &w-&c Only usable if you're not dual wielding.  &C(Mainly for spellcasters)
&z** &w-&c Only usable if you have the "dual" skill.  &C(Fighter classes)
&B
INVOKES ON ITEMS:
&cYou won't find many low level items with invokable spells on them, but just so
you're aware of their existance there are many items in the game that can be
"invoked" to produce a certain effect or spell.  An item may contain the spell
'fireshield' and if you invoke the item it casts that spell upon you or the
target you select.  These are primarily handy to the non-magical fighting
classes.
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
E
6~
&z--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&BFIGHTING PLAYERS VS MOBS:
&c  For attacking normal mobs simply type &w'&Rkill <mob name>&w'&c to start a fight with
them or if you are a thief type 'bs <mob name>' once you have the backstab
skill.  If you want to attack an animated corpse (you'll know when you come
across one) or a player (when you &R_BOTH_ &care in PK clans) you type &w'&Rmurder
<player>&w'&c to attack.
  If a fight isn't going well for you and you're likely to die if you don't find
a quick escape you simply need to type &B'&wflee&B'&c until you escape.  You will lose
a little bit of experience in the process, but it's better to lose 10xp than
lose half of what xp you've gained towards leveling.  Btw..it's 1000xp per
level.  In some areas flee doesn't work though, such as Dragon Valley though.
  Also, there are numerous "aggressive" mobs in the game that will automatically
attack you the moment you enter the room regardless of wether you wished to
fight or not.  So be wary of exploring high level areas or new areas without
shielding yourself against possible attack.
&B
ALIASES - Use and Creation&w:
&WSyntax&w:&r alias [shortcut] [task]  &C(Creates or modifies an alias)
&WSyntax&w:&r alias [shortcut]         &C(Deletes that alias)
&c  Aliases are common to many muds, but aren't found in all.  Basically these
are exactly what they sound like.  They're shortcut commands to preform larger
tasks.  &C(&BEx&w:&c having a shortcut command of 'fire' for performing the task, "cast
'fireball'"&C)&c.  This mainly just saves you on time and typing.  How it works:
&CExample&w:&c
<prompt> alias clb cast 'lightning breath'
Alias 'clb' added.
<prompt> clb
Cast spell on whom?
<prompt> clb dragon
Your blast of lightning MUTILATES the dragon.

&BCOMMON ABBREIVATIONS:
&cThis is just for those who are truely new to mudding since there are certain
terms mudders use all the time.
&BAFK    &w:&c Away From the Keyboard (Could also just be not paying attention)
&BPK     &w:&c Player Killing
&BMob    &w:&c Short for Mobile..meaning "creatures" in the MUD.
&BNewbie &w:&c You :)
&BRP     &w:&c Roleplay or Roleplaying
&BCR     &w:&c Corpse retrieval (Asking someone to help you get your corpse back)
&B
&BDESCRIPTION OF COMMUNICATION CHANNELS:
&cMany new players aren't sure how to communicate with others so I hope this helps
&POOC&w:&c      The general discussion channel..everyone sees it. Shortcut = ]
&RVent&w:&c     A form of OOC channel that isn't language censored.   All see it.
&CChat&w:&c     Role-playing channel..everyone sees it.  Shortcut = .
&RClantalk&w:&c ONLY those in your clan can see it.  Shortcut = cl
&CShout&w:&c    Everyone sees it, but it's an emergency channel, not a discussion one.
&CYell&w:&c     Everyone within the same AREA as you sees it.
&CSay&w:&c      Everyone in the same ROOM as you sees it.  Shortcut = '
&PEmote&w:&c    Everyone in the same ROOM sees it.  It's for actions not speaking.
&WTell&w:&c     ONLY the person you send it to sees it.  Tell <player> <message>
&cClass&w:&c    ONLY those of the same class as you see it.  Ie all thieves etc..

will see, "Arch grins sheepishly".

&BHELPFUL STARTING HINTS:
&cHere's a couple setting hints to get you started.  If you type "config" and
press enter you will see a list of "toggle" settings for your character.  A few
of these are as follows and as to how you might want them:
&w+&Rautoloot&w:&c Automatically take all equipment within a monster\player you have
           killed.  Handy at starting levels, but I'd suggest removing it after
           about level 10.
&w+&Rautoexit&w:&c Automatically lists available exits from rooms, except "door" exits.
&w+&Rautogold&w:&c Automatically take the money a creature had from it's corpse.
&w-&Ransi&w:&c     IF you don't have the ability to see color you want this off,
           otherwise leave it on and enjoy.
&w-&Rcombat&w:&c   This will take away seeing "you dodge.." "<mob> dodges...".  Reduces
           the spam a great deal.
&w+&Rkeep&w:&c     This keeps the MUD from autoputting in a new title for you each level
           so you can keep your own customized one.
&w-&Rfullname&w:&c This enables 'name completion' which allows you to be lazy and type
           only partial words.  To look at a salamander you might 'look sal' and
           it will take the first item\mob\player that begins with those letters
           it can find.
These are just to help you get started, but you're welcome to set them up as you
choose.  To set a "setting" like this you type: "config <+/-><setting>" so to
say set autoloot ON..you'd type "config +autoloot".
Another helpful feature of the mud is the PROMPT command.  Using it you can
customize your info prompt in color or appearance.  "help prompt" will show all
of the settings you can use, but here's a sample one that you can copy\paste in
the game for show:
&Cprompt [&&z%h&&c/&&z%H&&Bhp &&z%m&&c/&&z%M&&Bm &&w[%a][&&C%x&&wxp]:&&z
&cAssuming your a new character at level 1 this would look like:
&w[&z20&c/&z20&Bhp &z100&c/&z100&Bm &w[0][&C1000&wxp]:&z <whatever you type in game>
&C(The [0] is your alignment, which generally starts out at 0.)

&BHP, BLOOD, MANA & MOVEMENT:
&cAside from Str and it's like-statistics there is &CHP &c(Hit points), &CBlood &c(A
vampire's form of mana), &CMana &c(Amount of magical energy available) & &CMovement
&c(one's exhaution rating.).  These are fairly simple really:
&BHP&w:&c       It's in your prompt like 20/20hp.  This is lowered with each hit you
          take from a player or monster.  If it reaches below 1hp you die and
          you must get your stuff back from your corpse.
&BBlood&w:&c    If you're not a vampire don't worry about this.  Vampires use "blood"
          instead of "mana" that they can't regain via potions, but "feed" off
          victims to replenish it.
&BMana&w:&c     The amount of magical energy available to you.  So when a spell costs
          say..50ma (ma = mana) then if you have 1500/1500ma you go to
          1450/1500ma.  Potions will revitalize this somewhat though.
&BMovement&w:&c This of course is the MV stat and lowers as you move between rooms,
          but it's rare that you ever run out of movement.  Usually people just
          ignore it completely.
&cI'd suggest you &w-&Calways&w-&c train HP.  You'll have enough mana with potions,
movement wears down slowly and blood can't be trained.

&BSTATISTICS:
&cThe statistics I'm referring to here are &CStr&c (Strength), &CInt&c (Intelligence),
&CWis&c (Wisdom), &CDex&c (Dexterity) & &CCon&c (Consitution).  What they do is:
&BSTR&w:&c Increases the amount of weight your character is able to carry, allows you
     to wield heavier weapons & increases your damage in battle.
&BINT&w:&c Allows you to practice skills\spells faster.  25 Int that only Mages and
     Necromancers are able to acheive allows you to become "adept" in a skill or
     spell in one practice.
&BWIS&w:&c Determines the amount of practices you receive per level.  Normally you
     can't pass 22 WIS unless you're a cleric, druid or psionisist which can
     reach 25 WIS.  22 WIS = 7 Practices per level.  25 WIS = 8 practices.
&BDEX&w:&c Dexterity determines how well you dodge out of the way or how quickly you
     are able to parry an attack so it doesn't reach you.  Most classes can only
     reach 22 DEX, except thieves, bards & vampires, which are able to reach
     25 DEX.
&BCON&w:&c The "life" statistic.  Constitution adjusts how much HP per level you gain.
     The higher your CON stat is the more you receive each level depending on
     your class.  Each class earns a different range of HP per level.  Only
     rangers and monks can pass the 22 CON limit with their 25 CON.
&BI very strongly encourage you to train your stats in this order&w:
&CWIS&c,&C CON&c,&C INT&c,&C STR&c,&C DEX  (Dex & Str can be switched though)
&cThis way you max your practices gained per level quicker so you can train other
things faster and after that you get your con up so you gain as much hp per
level as possible.
Generally you can't get a statistic past 22, except the one statistic that is
your class' "main" statistic.  These main statistics are as follows:
&z                _______________&z______________________________&z_
&z                | Statistic    &z| Classes that have it        &z|
&z                |--------------&z|-----------------------------&z|
&z                | &BStrength     &z|&C Warrior, Paladin & Werewolf &z|
&z                | &BIntelligence &z|&C Mage & Necromancer          &z|
&z                | &BWisdom       &z|&C Cleric, Druid & Psionisist  &z|
&z                | &BDexterity    &z|&C Thief, Vampire & Bard       &z|
&z                | &BConstitution &z|&C Ranger & Monk               &z|
&z                |______________&z|_____________________________&z|

&BPRACTICING & TRAINING:
&cOn this mud, unlike some other forms of MUDs, you must train your primary
statistics (Str, Int, Wis, Dex & Con), plus you may also train your HP, mana &
move.  To do training you use "practices" that you receive each level based on
your Wisdom.  The higher your Wisdom the more practices you're able to get per
level.  To train a stat, like Str, it costs 5 practices per train, but to train
HP, mana or movement it costs only 1 practice.  Note: You can't train a statisti
c like Str past 18 regardless of class.  To train a stat you simply type: 
&wtrain <item> &R#  &C(&R#&C is for how many practices to use.  Ie: train hp 50)
&cPracticing is a bit more indepth where training deals with statistics,
practicing is how you aquire new skills and spells.  It only takes one
practice to improve a skill or spell, but how much it is improved depends upon
your Int statistic.  Plus different classes can practice to different amounts
such as a Mage's 95% and a Thief's 85%.  To practice a skill\spell you type:
&wpractice <skill name>  &C(don't put ""s around the name if it's 2+ words)

&OAt the &BValari river's &Obank&W~
&OThe &BI&bc&Cy &Bwaters&O of the Valari river rush by dragging sand from
along the shores of it's banks by the fierce currents in the rapids.  Not
far south the ground turns into a &Wdeep ice&O leading out into the &CArctic
Wastelands&O.  Why the &Wice&O has receded here is mystery though.  Off a
ways to the northwest lies a medium-sized city's outer walls.

&OA bend in the &Briver&O bank&W~
&OJust to the south the ground &Cfreezes&O to begin the region known as
the &WArctic Wastelands&O, although not a single trace of that area's
&Bi&bc&Cy chill&O seems to effect this strip of &Briver &Obank.  A lond
distance to the west the Averillen Mountains rise up into the &Wclouds&O and
at their feet give birth to the swift &CValari river&O.  To the east the
shoreline continues.

&OAlong the &BValari river's &Osouth bank&W~
&OTo the north a bit the &BValari river&O bends sharply southward heading
in your direction until it bends back eastward to pass beneath a long wooden
bridge a little to the east.  Not far south the ground lies in a permanent
state of &Cfrost&O with little or no ground showing beneath the deep mounds
of &Wsnow&O.

An abrupt end in the ice pathway~
&OYou stare out at the landscape before you as the first tinges of shock
pass at the lush valley before you.  Just to the south the passageway
continues back through the &Cfrozen &WArctic Wastelands&O, yet none of that
area's deep &Cchill&O seems to reach into this valley enterance.  A long
wooden bridge, showing signs of heavy rot, runs off to the north traversing
over the top of a rapid torn &Briver&O that banks sharply off to the north
after passing beneath the bridge.  The shoreline of the &Briver&O continues
to the east and west.

&OAlong a &Briver &Obank&W~
&OThe Arackier Peaks tower up abruptly just to the east blocking view of
the &BValari river's &Oeastward trek from here.  Far off to the north you're
able to see the opposite bank of the &Briver&O as well as a long wooden
bridge standing over the &Bwater's&O surface just to the northwest.

&OA rotting wooden bridge&W~
&OThe fast rapids of the &BValari river&O rush by beneath the long wooden
floorboards at your feet.  At sections of the bridge &Wwhite froth&O laps up
between the wooden planks.  Upon closer examination of the wood's condition
you notice several of the planks heavily warped and nearly all of them
thoroughly rotted through.  Perhaps continuing on as soon as possible would
be a good idea.  The idea of crashing through to the swift rapids just below
doesn't seem quite as appealing as the sandy shore a ways off to the north.

converge upon one another.  The southside of Alor Raharo's majestic northern
wall glistens brightly in the sunlight behind the massing mob of citizens
passing along on their individual tasks of the day.  Aim'is Avenue branches
off to the south while Marsim Way continues east over the Valari River via
the North Bridge and west on through western Alor Raharo.

&CAim'is Avenue&W~
&wThe number of wagons seems to have multiplied here as you come closer
to the intersection of Aim'is Avenue and Marsim Way, Alor Raharo's busiest
section of roadway.  A set of heavy oak doors lie to the east marking the
training building of Lord Adain's school on the arts of combat.  Aim'is
Avenue continues to the north and south.

&wA small puppy leaps forward in it's cage as you enter, barking
playfully at your presense.  Cages line all of the walls, except for the
back one from the door, stacked upon one another and nearly every one of
them housing a rodent or animal of some sort.  From exotic looking birds to
vicious looking wolves, dozens of pairs of eyes watch your every move
intently with a hope they might be set free of their encagement.

&CThe North Bridge&W~
&wHeavy-set stone blocks of gleaming white stand beneath your boots
forming the famous North Bridge of Alor Raharo.  It's said there was as much
magic put into the making of this bridge as there was physical labor, giving
it it's shine and ability to completely resist the elements.  Examining the
stonework a bit closer you can't even find one nick in the stone or even a
scratch to mar it's surface.  The water from the rushing Valari river
beneath sprays against it's outer sides, sliding rapidly back down into the
river across the smooth bridge's texture.

&wImpenatrable as stone, older than the younger immortals and carrying
the wisdom of countless centuries stands, Daran, the devoted oracle of Alor
Raharo.  Light shines brightly around the rims of his eyes as he turns your
direction searching your soul for the pureness in your heart.  Your mind
immediately strays a bit searching for any moment of your past in which you
fell from the grace of good nervously before his face softens a bit and his
arms spread in welcome.  Within his sanctuary you may find the answers your
troubled heart seeks.

have swallowed half of the common room except in small sections bathed
slightly in the light of a few lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  Men and a
few women sit in chairs around various tables either talking with companions
or simply content to peer into the depths of their mugs.  Serving girls rush
about with trays of mugs held balanced upon an arm with an air of experience
as they meander between tables collecting money from patrons or setting a
mug before one of them.
