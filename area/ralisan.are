jharel shopkeeper searnia~
Jharel~
Jharel, the local dabbler in the arcane arts, is here.
~
Dull grey colored hair spills down his back in neatly tied bundles with
two in the front on either side and one larger one down the middle of his
back.  A worn looking purple robe lies about his shoulders with enough
wrinkles to suggest it's been slept in more often than not.  Small slippers
peek out from beneath the robe's low hem.  Yet for all his appearance of
being absent-minded his blue eyes shine with a crystal light betraying a
deep intelligence beneath them.  His gaze searches your appearance
questioningly as he turns his head in your direction.

rinnus shopkeeper searnia~
Rinnus~
A strong armed man, named Rinnus, tends shop here.
~
Sweat trickles down the near stone-cut face of this hard man before you. 
His leg-thick arms alone make you ponder to yourself about how much he'd be
able to lift if needed.  A soot covered black leather blacksmith's vest
covers his chest and he's holding a heavy looking steel hammer in one hand
with it half-raised to strike down upon the piece of metal at the anvil he
was working before you came in.  His dark hazel eyes regard you somewhat
questioningly as he moves near where you wait.

deariv shopkeeper searnia~
Deariv~
Deariv, the town's weaponsmith, stands here polishing a broadsword.
~
A look of hard experience lies behind the dark hazel eyes regarding you. 
Deariv stands calmly polishing a long broadsword's blade with an oily rag. 
As you enter he sets turns the sword in his hand resting it's point into the
ground with his hands resting peacefully, or so you hope, upon the massive
hilt.  A look of question spreads across his face for just a moment at your
appearance, but disappears as quickly as it came.

arais shopkeeper searnia~
Arais~
A plump looking woman in a spotless white apron hustles about here.
~
Dry-washing her hands, Arais walks over and bobs a formal curtsey to you.
A look of open friendliness is shown on her face, first of it you've seen in
these lands, wether geniune or for business you find yourself not even
really caring.  Glancing at her casually you see by her appearance and the
appearance of her inn that she's very professional at her job and takes
pride in it.  Her face might have held a fair amount of beauty a dozen years
ago, but with time and the obvious strain of life as she's lived it wrinkles
have begun to mar that beauty.

Dlamar~
A tall, lanky man with flaring mustaches stands here.
~
Standing nearly a half a head taller than you while skinny to the point
of abnormally for his size, Dlamar makes an odd sight compared to his fellow
Searnian citizens.  Flaring black mustaches fan out on either side of
Dlamar's face as he looks at you questioningly.

elder man searnia~
The Village Elder~
The village's elder walks about here checking on his citizens.
~
Wrinkles crease the man's elderly face like a piece of crumpled up paper.
Yet despite his appearant age the man's intelligence seems still firmly in
control behind those piercing blue eyes.  A large medalion hangs about his
neck marking his rank of elder, thought very little about this man's actions
don't mark him as some form of leader.  Not through pushiness, but in the
way that people part before him with a warm smile and acknowledge his
presence as he walks by.  Small town or no, this man commands the kind of
respect few kings find in their followers.

A village citizen~
One of the village's many citizens wanders by here on an errand.
~
Carrying a bundled up sack of items his wife's sent him out to fetch this
man steps cautiously out of your way with merely a sidelong questioning
glance at your appearance.  Muttering to himself about the sack's weight he
continues on about his business paying you little outright attention.

A village citizen~
One of Ralisan's female citizens wanders about idling shoping.
~
Looking much like any other female citizen within the small cliff village
this lady steps out of your way cautiously sparing a sidelong questioning
glance in your direction.  Adjusting the basket of fruit looped around one
of her arms she moves on about her shopping for food without paying you any
more attention.

A child~
A small boy from Ralisan wanders about here.
~
Short and skinny, this little boy hops about looking for new mischief to
get himself into.  His hazel eyes regard you for a moment with a question in
them, but he quickly looks away looking for something of more interest to
his life.  Walking barefoot he pads by you, with a pair of brown breeches
and a grayish-tan colored tunic as the rest of his outfit, by a casual
glance.

villagers.  She glances at your appearance questioningly, then looks away
for something of more interest to her.  A white blouse paired with a skirt

Keim~
Keim, Captain of the Ralisan Garrison, walks here keeping the peace.
~
You size Keim up with your glance noting his rather well trained stance,
ready to handle any problems this town may incur.  One hand lies above his
eyes shielding them from the sky's light while the other rests on the hilt
of his sword.  His armor glistens with an almost glassy look while made of
chain rings making you wonder if it's completely natural.

A Ralisan gateguard~
A stocky gateguard stands here watching Ralisan's exit.
~
Dark hazel eyes study you from behind an experience hardened face as the
guard stands at his post at the Ralisan gate.  Lifting a hand to shade his
eyes he looks in your way with a weighing glance.  The shadow of a question
brushes past his facial features, but he lets it slip and allows you to pass
unhindered.  The hand resting on his sword hilt in an almost casual way
betrays his distrust of your appearance though.

athrel gleeman ralisan searnia~
Athrel~
A man wearing a cloak made of colourful patches walks about juggling balls.
~
A large colourful cloak made from nearly two hundred differently colored
patches covers Athrel.  Black hair hangs in a short tail at his neck with
the rest of it hand-scrubbed out of his face.  A wooden flute case and harp
case hang over his shoulder tied together by a small black cord.  Noticing
your eyes, he whips his hand drawing a throwing knife from somewhere within
his cloak and just as quickly resheathing it back within those patches. 
Athrel unconciously resumes his juggling performance switching from his
circle of eight colorful balls to two circles of four that intertwine.

Long dark hair curles it's way down her back dangling down the back of
her white serving dress.  A white apron is tied around her front containing
few smuges of dirt.  At your look she flashes you a quick smile, with only a
hint of interest at your appearance in her hazel eyes.  She turns away and
hurries over to serve a mug of ale to a patron at the end of the bar.

A wealthy merchant~
A wealthy merchant lady sits in her wagon here.
~
Sitting casually in her wagon seemingly ignoring the citizens passing by,
this wealthy merchant lady idly studies one of her ringed fingers.  Her blue
silk gown doesn't even have a single wrinkle perched in her seat with yellow
embriodery up it's arms and middle.  A belt of woven silver encircles her
slim waist hidden almost completely by the folds of her gown, pushed up from
the wagon seat.  She glances at you with a mild interest at your appearance.

Bushy white hair peeks out from beneath a black wide-brimmed hat perched
atop this older man's head.  Long mustaches snake down either side of his
face still retaining some dark flecks of hair mixed in with the mainly white
colors.  Dressed in a simple countryman's garb he sits upon the wagon's seat
watching the road ahead calling for citizens to make way and deftly keeping
the wagon's animals from running into anyone.

Just beyond the woods~
The Northern Averil forest stretches both north and west of you, turning
the open Mareci Pass into a thick, forest of trees, too dark to see far in. 
The western edge of the monsterous Harad Peak knife's it's way into the
forest's edge a ways to the east.  South of you the Mareci Pass extends
beyond your line of sight.

skyrockets into the clouds in the east, it's &Bs&bn&Co&cw&wy &Bp&be&Ca&ck&Y &creaching for the

Standing nearly in the middle of the the Mareci Pass you stop for a
moment to take in the breath-taking view.  Towering Harad Peak's western
face ends in a sheer cliff forming the eastern boundry of the pass, while to
the west another equally sheer cliff rises up nearly seventy paces above
you.  Just over the edge of the western cliff you're able to make out the
rooftops of a village.  To the north and south the Pass extends beyond your
range of sight.

side cut off in a sheer face at the bottom, looms high above you nearly
eighty paces to where it angles out towards the mountain's snowy peak.  The
valley's eastern cliff boundry wraps around north of you, blocking passage

The southern side of Harad Peak~
&cReaching nearly to your knee's height, a light mist cloaks the ground
from your sight.  Harad Peak's bulky form lies directly northeast of you
from here, shadowing the valley with it's immensity.  To the southeast the
Mareci Pass exits out into a dark forest with the same fog enshrouding it's
floor.

Western exit of the Mareci Pass~
The Mareci Pass narrows into a thin bottle-neck exit here as it forms
it's southwestern end into a small passageway through the cliffs of
Searnia's western lands.  The cliff's edge towers roughly sixty paces above
your head, casting dark shadows across the passageway's width.  The
passageway leads west.

Just a little bit to the west the Mareci Pass exits out it's southwestern
end into a small passageway through the lower cliff's of Searnia's western
lands.  The western cliff itself bathes the passageway in shadows preventing
you from being able to see too far into it.  Directly south of you towers
the southern cliff boundry of the Mareci Pass.  Off to the north the pass
extends beyond the horizon.

A ways off to the west you're able to see where the pass exits out into a

shadows cloaking the passageway cast by the towering bulk of the lower
cliff's southern side prevents you from see beyond the passage's enterance.

the cliffside a cool blast of air hits you, freezing you to the bone far
more than any wind should when surrounded by temperature like this. 
Something about this entire valley's weather doesn't seem right.  How could
it be this warm weathered when it lies north of even the Arctic Wastelands?

the citizens of Ralisan go about their daily lives.  The uneven cobblestone
road you stand in heads on towards the north before bending eastward and it
heads to the south until it meet's Ralisan's southern gate a ways off.

&bOld wooden barrels lie areas of the store's inner walls containing odd
assortments of sword, broadswords, halberds, spears, quarterstaffs or axes
of varying size.  A forge's heat comes from behind a closed door to the
back, along with the sounds of hammering.  Walking in a bit further you come
to a counter containing various daggers and throwing knives set on their
sides with the tip facing outward.

Rinnus' Blacksmithy & Armor Shop~
&bIntense heat envelopes you as you enter the room, drawing beads of
sweat upon your forehead.  A few men work at a large set of pillows keeping
the forge's fire hot, while another man works steadily bringing down a heavy
blacksmith's hammer upon a piece of metal resting on a black anvil.  Bits
and pieces of armor hang up along the walls all across the walls, except for
a section to the back that holds tools ranging from tongs to chippers of all
sorts.
