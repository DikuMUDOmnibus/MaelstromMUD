Love~
the Energy of Love~
Love, in it's purest form, &rS&bW&pI&YR&WL&CS &Pall around you here.
~
You never thought a sight as beautiful as this would be possible.
Streams of colors float through the air, and surround you with a million
tiny rainbows.  The colors seem to make a soft, pleasing noise as they pass
you, almost as if they were singing to you.

The Entrance to The Garden of Whispers~
As you step through the small opening you found hidden within the lush
hedge, leaving it behind you, you find yourself standing before a garden
paradise.  Everywhere you look, your line of vision is filled with tall
trees and hedges, the most vibrantly colored exotic flowers and small
animals scurrying across the path.  As you look towards the sky, you can
barely see the tops of what appear to be tall stone statues.  A soft breeze
seems to whisper "Intruder" as it gently passes your ear and you turn to
leave.  In horror, you find that the opening in which you entered this place
has sealed itself, leaving you with no way out.  The cobblestone path leads
east and south.

The Garden of Whispers~
As you walk slowly along this cobblestone pathway, the tall trees and
hedges that surround the pathway on both sides seem to be closing in on you
as they block your vision from the rest of the garden.  Footsteps need to be
chosen carefully to ensure the safety of the delicate flowers that also line
the path.  The angelic scents of the roses, daisies, carnations and many
other types of flowers seem to be soothing to this place.  In the distance
you hear a sparrow chirping, it's music is carried to your ears by a cool,
gentle breeze.  The path continues both east and west.

A Rickety Old Tool Shed~
As you enter this small shed, your eyes are instantly assaulted by a
thick cloud of dust.  Boxes filled with rows of beautiful flowers lay
scattered on the floor all around you.  Stacked against the wall to your
left are giant bags of dirt and fertilizer.  Above the stacks, covering the
entire width of the wall, is a rack full of various gardening tools.  In the
far right corner you see a large rusty wheelbarrow.  The gardener must be
extremely strong to be able to push it all around the garden.  To the south
you can see a large fountain.  The path extends south.

The Fountain of the Rose~
The shadow of this enormous statue shades you from the heat here.  This
rendition of a single red rose is quite possibly the most beautiful in
existence.  A thin mist sprays upwards, covering the leaves and petals in a
million tiny drops from a pool of water below.  The detail that was taken in
creating this wonder is magnificent.  Each petal is perfectly formed,
painted in a bright shade of red.  Each leaf also pefrect, right down to the
detail in it's veins.  A small brass plaque has been fastened to the base of
the fountain.  To the north you can see a small shed.  The path continues in
all directions.

The air around this small brook is cool, fresh and sweetly scented.  Pure
spring water flows gently through the bed of the brook.  The sound of the
water flowing past the sparkling rocks which lay in the brook bed seems to
be calming to the plants around it.  The vibrantly colored flowers are
thankful to have the water so near.  The trees seem to sing as they sway
gently in thesoft breeze.  To the north you can see a large fountain.  The
brook flows both north and south.

The Garden of Whispers~
As you walk slowly along this cobblestone pathway, the tall trees and
hedges that surround the pathway on both sides seem to be closing in on you
as they block your vision from the rest of the garden.  Footsteps need to be
chosen carefully to ensure the safety of the delicate flowers that also line
the path.  The angelic scents of the roses, daisies, carnations and many
other types of flowers seem to be soothing to this place.  In the distance
you hear a sparrow chirping, it's music is carried to your ears by a cool,
gentle breeze.  To the east you can see a large fountain.  The path
continues both east and west.

The Fountain of the Vampire Lord.~
Standing before you is the statue of an eerie looking man.  His pitch
black hair is short and brushed back off his face.  His eyes appear to be
hazel, almost yellow.  His bright ruby lips form a frightening smile.  His
tall lean body is clothed in all black with the exception of the red lining
on his cape.  Falling from the two fangs which can be seen in the corner of
his mouth are tiny red droplets which form a pool below.  A brass plaque is
fastened to the base of the fountain.  To the south you can see a small
shed.  The path continues in all directions.

Beside a Small Brook~
The air around this small brook is cool, fresh and sweetly scented.  Pure
spring water flows gently through the bed of the brook.  The sound of the
water flowing past the sparkling rocks which lay in the brook bed seems to
be calming to the plants around it.  The vibrantly colored flowers are
thankful to have the water so near.  The trees seem to sing as they sway
gently in the soft breeze.  To the south you can see a small shed.  The
brook flows north, east and south.

A Rickety Old Tool Shed~
As you enter this small shed, your eyes are instantly assaulted by a
thick cloud of dust.  Boxes filled with rows of beautiful flowers lay
scattered on the floor all around you.  Stacked against the wall to your
left are giant bags of dirt and fertilizer.  Above the stacks, covering the
entire width of the wall, is a rack full of various gardening tools.  In the
far right corner you see a large rusty wheelbarrow.  The gardener must be
extremely strong to be able to push it all around the garden.  To the north
you see a large fountain.  The path extends north.

The Fountain of the Sparrow.~
This large statue appears almost life-like, with the exception of the
absence of movement.  Carved in white marbel are a dozen tiny sparrows, each
bending down for a drink.  Their small brown bodies and grey tinted wings
seem to shine here.  The pool, filled with the clear sparkling water, is
also contained in a marble casing.  A gentle breeze blows past you, making
tiny ripples in the water.  A brass plaque is attached to the base of this
fountain.  The path continues in all directions.

The Garden of Whispers~
As you walk slowly along this cobblestone pathway, the tall trees and
hedges that surround the pathway on both sides seem to be closing in on you
as they block your vision from the rest of the garden.  Footsteps need to be
chosen carefully to ensure the safety of the delicate flowers that also line
the path.  The angelic scents of the roses, daisies, carnations and many
other types of flowers seem to be soothing to this place.  In the distance
you hear a sparrow chirping, it's music is carried to your ears by a cool,
gentle breeze.  To the north you can see a small shed.  The path continues
north, east and south.

A Rickety Old Tool Shed~
As you enter this small shed, your eyes are instantly assaulted by a
thick cloud of dust.  Boxes filled with rows of beautiful flowers lay
scattered on the floor all around you.  Stacked against the wall to your
left are giant bags of dirt and fertilizer.  Above the stacks, covering the
entire width of the wall, is a rack full of various gardening tools.  In the
far right corner you see a large rusty wheelbarrow.  The gardener must be
extremely strong to be able to push it all around the garden.  The path
extends west.
