George~
There is a purple thing crawling on the ceiling here.
~
The critter is a one eyed, one horned, crawling, purple, people eater.
It tries to eat anyone that enters the room but since he has no teeth, he just slobbers all over you.

Grunt's Inner Demons~
A mass of burning souls howls in agony as it twists about the room.
~
The inner demons have somehow escaped from Grunt's subconcious and
manifested themselves upon the physical world.  Looking closely you see
flashes of pain, fear, despair, and hate sweep across the faces which rise
to the surface of this hovering mass.  To fight this abomination is useless,
for only Grunt himself can release it from this world, and that is a
difficult task, even for him.

&CIf there were &Wclouds&C in the Hall of the Gods, this would be the place.
This is where all &Wdreams&C are made. It is said that all forms of Earthly
Weather are made by the Gods of &BCREATION&C. This "legend" is in fact, a truth.
This weather, as they say is the actual brain storming of the creators at
work. No decision is made lightly, and no idea is born unconsidered. Care and
detail are put into every creation born, as there is nothing more important
to the Gods than the Children of &YThe Storm&C.

&WKnow ye that herein lie the rules that govern &BCREATION&W.  Out of the
chaos of the premature destruction of &YThe Storm&W were we created, and out
of this we must create order.  This is our duty and responsibility.  To this
end, the following guidelines and procedures are to be met.  
 
&B-&WIf an area is ready to be checked, it is your duty to make sure that it is
 complete and to inform &RThe Storm Lord&W and &BCreation Guildmaster&W.
&B-&WIn doing this, you must state two(2) options of where you wish the area to be
 linked (you know your area best, use your good judgement).
&B-&WThe &BCreation Guildmaster&W will then go through the area, informing you of any
 critiques regarding the quality of the area
&B-&WAll guidelines found in &YGrunt Neanderthal's Unabuilder&W and in the
&Y Mobprogramming Guide by Angi and Wynn &Wmust be followed unless cleared by
&R The Storm Lord&W or &BCreation Guildmaster&W.
&B-&WNo one but &RThe Storm Lord&W or &BCreation Guildmaster&W is to link an area
 or build in areas not their own (unless appointed by the &RLord&W or &BGuildmaster&W).
&B-&WAll new areas to be built are to be approved by &RThe Storm Lord&W and/or
&B Creation Guildmaster &Wbefore vnums are assigned.
&B-&WIn order to receive varification, you must inform the &BGuildmaster&W of
 the concept, level range and size of the area when requesting vnums.
&B-&WIt is the responsibility of the &BGuildmaster to check and link areas as
 soon as possible and to ensure quality.
&B-&WIt it the duty of the Guild &BMembers &Wto be thorough and to keep the
 Guild informed.
&B-&WProlonged negligence of the above rules shall be viewed as grounds for
 dismissal from the Guild. In additiong, extended periods of time in which a
&B Member &Wdoes not accomplish any of the above functions can be viewed as
 grounds for dismissal from the &BGuild&W.
&B-&WAbove all, remember that we are here to serve &YThe Storm&W and are
 basically nothing more than glorified builders with administrative
 responsibilities.

dreams~
&pRemember, when making your area always keep with the medieval theme
that we have going here on our Mud. It is usually a good idea to have
mapped out some or all of your area (on paper) before getting to work
online. This will give you more of an idea as to how many vnums you will
need and where you will go with it. No idea is a bad idea, although
modifications are often necessary. You all work very hard at what you
do. We at The Storm appreciate you and send out our gratitude. Work
hard, pace yourself and get things done right the first time.

&pThe House of &RNeanderthal&p.~
The room is very large and extremely cold, with no windows whatsoever as
far as you can see.  The air is very damp and stale, and the dim light given
off by a couple of flickering black candles is barely enough to see by.  The
presence of some sort of dreary sorrow hangs about the room like a thick
fog, enveloping you and attempting to suck you in.

&YThis is Angi's special room.  Here Angi sits back and watches the world
go by.  A huge fireplace is built into one wall.  It's warm, soft glow is
the only light in the room.  A deep plush couch seems to be Angi's favorite
spot as it is where you can find her most nights.  Whether she is curled up,
gazing into the romantic flames or sitting on the edge of the couch, working
on the code, she's always here.  Feel privileged, and don't make a lot of
noise.  This is Angi's special place.

Xavier's Home for Old Warriors of the Storm~
You have entered Xavier's Home for Old Warriors of the Storm.  This room
is a spot where old friends can meet and reminicse about old times and
fallen comrades.  In one corner there is a pretty young pixie in a nurses
uniform serving a mild decaffinated coffee for those who are weak of
bladder.  In the far corner, there is a bar specializing in drinks for those
of a slightly stronger constitution.  Have no fear, all drinks are based
upon prune juice.  There are lots of ways for all of our aged warriors to
relax here.  In the middle of the room there is a nice pool table, and you
think you see a couple of your former brothers-in-arms at the shuffle board
area over against the wall.  To your amazment, you realize that this place
is what you finally deserve after all those years of battle, a nice quiet
place to relax, swap lies about monsters you fought and complain about
how today's warriors just don't seem as tough as in your day. Enjoy yourself
here!

window, with a balcony where Flint can stretch out and relax.  Near the
window, is a large wooden desk, that is covered with papers, books, and
various implements of death.  Hanging over the doors, are a set of epees,
crossed in the center of the blades.  A large slate pool table is sitting
near the east wall.
