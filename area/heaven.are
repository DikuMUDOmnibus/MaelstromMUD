mpechoat $n HELLO $N!!! YOU HAVE PASSED MANY TRIALS TO REACH THIS FAR IN YOUR
mpechoat $n JOURNEYS! NOW YOU STAND BEFORE *ME*, THE CREATOR OF THE WORLD.
mpechoat $n WHAT SHALL YOU DO NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE? SHALL YOU LEARN THE SECRETS
mpechoat $n OF THE WORLD? LEARN THE MEANING OF LIFE? SUCH IGNORANCE TO SUCH
mpechoat $n JUVENILLE QUESTIONS I FIND QUITE AMUSING. OR PERHAPS YOUR VISIT HERE
mpechoat $n WAS OF A TOTALLY DIFFERENT NATURE, PERHAPS YOU WISH TO POSSESS THE
mpechoat $n GREATEST PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT YOU SHALL EVER KNOW! SPEAK $N!

mpechoat $n AHH YOU WISH TO KNOW THE PURPOSE OF DEATH! SUCH A SIMPLE QUESTION.
mpechoat $n DEATH IS SIMPLE THE TIME I DECIDE THAT YOUR PRESENCE IN THE MORTAL
mpechoat $n IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. YOU SEE IF EVERYONE LIVED FOREVER, THE
mpechoat $n AMOUNT OF STAGNATION AND BOREDOM WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO BEAR.  MY
mpechoat $n GIFT OF DEATH GIVES YOU MORTALS A LARGER CAPACTIY TO ENJOY LIFE,
mpechoat $n TO EXPERIENCE WILD THRILLS AND ALL AND ALL MAKE MORE OF YOUR LIFE
mpechoat $n THEN YOU OTHERWISE WOULD.
endif

>speech_prog life~
if ispc($n)
mpechoat $n THE MEANING OF LIFE YOU WISH TO KNOW DO YOU. LIFE IS AS YOU SEE IT
mpechoat $n IS SOMETHING LIKE A DREAM WHERE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE DREAM
mpechoat $n ARE SET BY THE DREAMER. LIFE IS REALLY A FIGURATIVE TERM SINCE
mpechoat $n REALLY YOUR REAL ESSENCE HAS AND SHALL CONTINUE TO EXIST EVEN
mpechoat $n BEYOND WHAT IT IS YOU CALL 'LIFE'.

~
>speech_prog power~
if ispc($n)
mpechoat $n SO YOU WISH TO KNOW WHAT TRUE POWER IS? LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE
mpechoat $n ONLY *TRUE* POWER LIES IN THE ABILITY TO MAKE SOMETHING REAL OUT
mpechoat $n OF SOMETHING THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS NOT. THE POWER OF CREATION, TO
mpechoat $n MOLD SOMETHING TO YOUR VERY WILL AND FOR IT TO BECOME A PART OF YOU
mpechoat $n IS AN EXAMPLE OF REAL POWER $n

Entrance to Purgatory~
You have entered into what seems to be the beginning of the afterlife.
Although it is possible for mortals to enter into this realm, it is hardly a
place for them to be. The way of the ethereal is treacherous indeed and can
be hazardous for any mortals life, for the dead look upon your life with
contempt as they realize what they have lost.

A Hallway in Purgatory~
Purgatory, the realm of waiting for judgement is not a pretty place. Tormented
souls wait to be either admitted into heaven or passed down into hell. Being
that such a decision last an eternity it is obvious why the people here seem
so agitated. All around you people wander mindless around talking to nobody
in particular and everybody at the same time.

Although it is not really a 'bad' place, something here just does not
feel right...its as though something is missing. Around you the
resident souls wander lostly, for they shall be stuck in this place
for eternity or until some poor mortal prays for their sins. Indeed
it is not very hopeful for these people and yet still a faint flicker
of hope remains in their eyes.

Before you stands the master of time himself, Chrono, the Incarnation of Time.
He watches you thoughtfully waiting for you to do something as if he already
knows what you are about to do. Well, being the Incarnation of Time you are
fairly sure that if you choose to attack him and gain admittance to the
Stairway to Heaven, the element of surprise will not be on your side...

stand ready to attack anything that moves....fortunately it seems that
everything is dead already, however its always better to be safe then sorry.

defend the Incarnation of Death, Thanatos. If you think yourself worthy to
face Death himself continue onwards for surely this is the right direction,
however if you feel yourself to be no match for the very person who could rip
your soul from your body with no thought at all, perhaps it would be best
to head back.

In fact, if you could, it would probably be in your best interest just to

The Hallway of Saints~
The hallway of saints is a sanctuary for those mortals of earth whose faith
in God was so strong that they became saintly. Their paradise consists
mostly of praying to God and thanking Him for what He has given them.
Lost unto their own little world, many of the saints have forgotten about
the world that is and have abandoned the mortals unto their own doings.

Arch-Angel Gabriel's Home~
The home of Gabriel is very neat and particular as everything has its
proper place.  The label 'the executioner' has been put on this angel for
the very fact that he is God's own angel of death!  Tread carefully mortals
for the very breath from Gabriel's mouth means death!

The Abode of the Arch-Angel Michael~
The home of Michael is cluttered with papers and other administration utensils.
Michael's job is a very tedious one as he must oversee all the lesser angels
activities, where they shall preach The Word, what miracles to perform and
where, ecetera. You are very lucky that Michael doesn't just ignore you
completely!

A Small Store~
A small store lies off to the side of Purgatory. It seems even the souls here
must eat something to sustain themselves, although the shop really doesn't
look that busy. Hmm...perhaps its just because all they sell is bread and
water. Who would wanna eat that for eternity...?

You have entered into the underground cellar of Cleatus' shop. It seems that
Cleatus has set up some kind of illegal trades in this room and it surely
would not go well with the boys upstairs if they ever heard about this!
Quivering, Cleatus offers his wares to you pleading for your mercy. Surely
this is an advantage that does not come along very often!

The Room of Confession~
The confession room has been the home for the fallen apostle since the very
moment he betrayed Jesus. Never has Judas actually been dead, but he has
instead been granted immortality since it will take him to the end of time
to pay for the sins he has committed. Pity this poor man for his suffering
has been more then any man could possibly spare.

&WThe dwelling place of God brings tears to your eyes.  The brillance and
magnificance of being face to face with the being that created you and every
other thing you have every known is too much to bear.  Your very gaze upon
this man crys havoc in your brain, He is too much to understand, to great for
your comprehension!  The only answer shall lie in the death of your creator,
the death of your God!  It is the only answer...
