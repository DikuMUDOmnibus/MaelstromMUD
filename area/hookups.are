cobblestones of various types.  You may continue on the cobblestone path to
the east, or towards a large town to the north.

A closer look at the remains of this poor creature reveals that it is a

remains~
The bloody carcass of this animal is too fresh to give off any smell but
those of blood and guts.  A closer examination reveals that it was killed by
another animal, yet only a small portion has been eaten.  Perhaps the killer
was driven away by a fiercer predator.

A Path Leading from the Village~
The southern edges of the shanty town known as Villein Village shows out
from beyond the small arch of trees to the west.  Shining brightly in the
sun, gleaming towers of pure silver loom above the treetops to the southwest
marking the famous Silver Castle.  The path continues to the east and
outlets to the west.

Carved out of a length of receding trees this path continues to the east
or leads back west towards the Villein Village's south end.  Trees cover
each side of this small dusty path with the faint sound of falling leaves in
the background.  The path continues to the west and the east.

oaks surrounding it.  The chirping of birds can be heard faintly in the

A small brook crosses the path here, with a few rickety planks of wood
bridging it.  The trees tower to either side of the path, as it bends
sharply to the south and west.  A brightly colored blue stone in the brook
catches your eye as the water gurgles over it.

far more light than could possibly be reflected by the faint light in this
forest.

are actually seeing this spectacle in front of you.
