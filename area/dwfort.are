Home of a Dwarven Citizen~
Furniture here is pretty scarce.  Taxes must be taking their toll in this
household.  Looks like the owner could only a afford a small mattress on the
floor, and a little writing table with chair.

dare, the General Store supplies their basic adventuring necessities.

of someday joining the Clan and bettering his humble lot in life.  It
appears you've dropped in just in time for dinner.  The table is set with
steaming lizard stew being the main course.

You get the distinct impression you really don't belong here.  The
crests hanging off the walls don't make a whole lot of sense.  The strange
vibration coming from the north scares the stuffing out of you, and, come to
think of it, you remember you have an appointment with a tooth-extraction
mage somewhere far, far away from this mountain.
