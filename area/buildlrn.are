&YGENERAL COST VALUE FOR FOODS

1 copper per food hour.
Anything over 10 hours is 1 silver per food hour.

&p**&YExotics and rare dishes are expensive. Most food in castles or
  manors will be over-priced.&p**

&YI'm sure that there are many food types and dishes that I have missed
in this book. However, use your good judgement, and/or take the max
from something in this book that is Like what you have. Don't make
things with too little or too many food hours.

&WHappy building and stay creative!

#ROOMDATA

Entrance to Builders University~
Welcome to the School for new builders.  As you travel through each room,
carefully study the lessons taught within.  The final room will have an
exam, which you must send me a note with the answers.  If you pass, you will
be allowed to build, if you fail, you go back to school until you learn.
Building is not for everybody, and I wish to be selective in who I choose.

&WHOW TO DO RESETS~
The syntax is:
&RMreset &P(mob vnum) &B(Max in AREA) &w-resets a mob to CURRENT ROOM
&ROreset &P(obj vnum) &B(Mob name) &W(wear-loc)&w-resets an obj to mob in room.
&ROreset &P(obj vnum) -resets an obj in room on floor/ground

&YUse common sense when doing resets. There's a certain order which works:
Mob. Items on mob. Items on floor.
If there's more than one mob, make sure they don't have the same name,
or things will get screwy.
Also, make the mob SENTINEL while you type in the resets, then remove it.
The mud needs the mob in the room to do the resets correctly.

If there's more than one mob, make sure you FINISH EQUIPPING
The FIRST MOB before moving on to the next one!

Only reset mobs/objs from the vnums you were given.. don't reset stuff from other areas.

If there's more than one of the SAME MOB (same vnum):

set the max that should be in entire area.. (so if the same mob apears
once in 2 different rooms.. max is 2)
equip only one mob in each room.
simple.

Ok first you need to create a room.
REDIT create (vnum) (our examples will use 1234)
you should use one of the vnums assigned to you for this.
You will get a Room Created message. (Hint: ALWAYS watch the replies you get)
Next Up: Short desc. this is the NAME of the room
The name of the room you are in is 'A lesson in ROOM editting' for example.
After you have set the name, the next part is the Long Description.
This is what people will see, your chance to give information about the room
itself.
You can edit the room desc. by typing desc and enter
(Note after typing in the description, always .f (format) and .s (show
this allows you to proofread your work and make it look neat.)
You now have a room. With a description.
What next? Exits! People may want to leave occasionally..
The syntax is:
dir (dig/link/room) vnum
Dir is for north,south,east,west,up,down
dig= Digs a 2 way exit and creates the vnum room specified
link= links this room to another existing room with a 2 way exit.
room= makes a one way exit (Use only in RARE instances)
Want a door? make one!
the syntax is direction (flag)
available flags are:
door: makes a door
closed: defaults the door closed
locked: the door is locked. you need a key to open it,
the thing to do is make an object and use it's vnum as the key
so if the door is locked, south key vnum sets the obj vnum as the key.
other flags to add are:
pickproof: picklock always fails.
bashproof: You hit the door hard, but it wont budge
NOTE: Make sure BOTH sides of the door have a key flag, unless
it is a one-way locking door (coffin lid, secret passage)
ALSO: if it's a door, make sure it is named that
the door flag does not name the exit a door, just makes
a door there.
use dir name exitname
ex: south exit door
or north exit gate
