Entrance to the Arena~
High fence surrounds the entire Arena, for your protection as well as the
animals'.  As you gaze across the large pit, you should be able to see
various animals to battle with.  You can travel east, west or south to
explore the Arena.  To reach a &Wsafe&c haven, go up.

North East Corner~
You're in the North East corner of the Pit of Decay.  You notice that there is
a small neat little pile of bones that have been left here.  Then you notice
that something about it still seems to be moving.  You realize that it's snakes
crawling through the bones.  Ick!  The stench here seems to be unconquerable
as you go through this pit, trying to find somewhere that you can enjoy your
lunch!

one side that the maggots seem to be crawling all over.  You don't want to

rolling mass of something or other off to the west.  Maybe that's people in
danger, or maybe they're just more of those wonderfully disgusting features
of this pit.

other wonderful leeches, maggots, chickens, oh what a wonderful scene.  Then
you glance down and realize, woops, you're treading on someone's toes,
literally.

carrying you away to another room.  Maybe you should watch your footing?

be seeping through the cracks in the wall.  You wonder, where did all this
ooze come from?!  Who created all this?!  Is there no end to it all?  With
weary resignation, you continue to plod on in this pit.  Oh wait, you can
just go up to escape all this.  
There is also a rusty &Ggrate &Yhere.

notice that there are some minute looking bugs, eating away at whatever the
message was written in.  Perhaps it's not so good to anger these bugs.

Safe Haven of the Pit~
Looking down in surprise, you realize, you're standing on moderately clean
ground!  The only ooze on this floor is that from the previous pairs of feet
that have tracked it through.  Then, another surprise comes, there's no bugs
here to pester you.  A general aura of peace extends from the healer.  Maybe
you've finally found that nice spot to have your lunch.  Still hungry?

a place to eat your lunch!

Lying under a pile of the strange ooze of the pit, lies what looks like some
type of mound.  At a closer glance however, you realize that the ooze is
actually covering the remains of some poor adventurer.  But, the ooze is
beginning to eat away at the remains!  Ick, maybe it does serve a purpose
after all.  You wonder if it waits for you to die, first.

You find yourself in the actual pit, itself.  The ground is covered with a
thick ooze that looks slimy.  You hope you don't fall into it!  Around you a
horrid stench rises and makes you reel.  Altogether, you're looking forward to
getting out of this place sometime soon!  Oh look, there's a finger lying in
the ooze.

This dimly lit passageway is damp and musty smelling, and far off in the
distance water can be heard dripping.  The scurrying of some kind of
creature echoes off the moss-encrusted walls, and various other strange
sounds resound.  In the dim light an exit north can be seen, and the grate
leading back to where you came from is here.

Then you realize why, it's pulsating a faint orange!  Ugh, and now it's
moving!  Oh no!  Oh wait, now it's not, and it's not glowing either.  It's just
a rotting orange and banana peel being carried off by a chicken.  You realize
that you're now beginning to sweat, too bad there's no wind in here.  It just
might have improved the smell!

There are exits in all of the four cardinal directions.  None of them
look promising.  All are too dark to see beyond the doorways so you are
afforded no clues as to which route is the safest to take.  The scratching
of some type of animals can be heard echoing throughout the area, and the
air is damp and musty.  The faint sounds of maniacal laughter can also be
heard.  This doesn't look good.

The Crazed Workshop~
The first thing that catches your eye in this room is the amount of blood
covering the floor, walls, and most surfaces here.  Various other bodily
fluids and matter join in to make this room look like total carnage.  Dim
lighting makes it difficult to see distinctly, so all that can be discerned
are a large table against the west wall, what appear to be piles of body
parts, a few piles of what appear to be organs, and heading the mayhem, a
large shape bent over the table, whistling while he works.

in this.  The only exits are north and east.

chair behind it, and a few cheap-looking pictures adorning the walls are all

dusting of mold on them.  The desk and chair have been warped by years of
