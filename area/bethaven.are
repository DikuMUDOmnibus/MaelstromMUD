Temple of Bethaven~
Within this chamber stands the great and ancient Oracle.  He has stood in
this spot since long before the dawning of the Storm, and shall continue
into eternity.  Standing directly in the centre of the room is a huge altar
carved from one solid granite stone.  It's surface is carved with intricate
designs and symbols.  It is here that the citizens of Bethaven come to heal
and rest, and to share in the glory of eternity.  There is a door set into
the northern wall, with an inscription carved upon it.

Judgement Pass~
Judgement Pass stands just outside of the mighty Temple of Bethaven.  It
is here that the greatest warrior in the land stands her post, protecting
the citizens of Bethaven from the evil that dwells in every heart.  It is
here that judgement is dealt, swift and without mercy.  There is a set of
stairs leading upwards into the academy, where newcomers to the Storm can
learn to survive in the harsh and rugged land.

Fountain Plaza~
A large fountain stands in the middle of the plaza and offers a drink to
any passing traveller.  The water is clear and cool, and the fountain itself
is large and carved out of marble.  Adventurers from across the realm gather
here to replenish their drinking supply and to exchange gossip and tales of
the wild lands beyond the Bethaven gates.

Main Street~
The main street of Bethaven is a very wide cobblestone street. Adventurers
of all races and occupations can be seen walking up and down the street.
Common citizens of Bethaven can also be seen going about their daily
activities. The occasional cityguard ensures that peace and justice will
be upheld in this fine city, although the thugs and ruffians do present a
minor crime problem.

Crossing of Main and Storm~
The crossing of Storm and Main is busy, but the throng of people is still
bearable.  Every now and then, a fight erupts between an arrogant mage and
an equally arrogant adventurer.  Sounds of pyrotechnics, hacking, slashing,
and screams of pain fill the air.  Few people take notice of these actions
because they have grown accustomed to open feuding in the streets.  The
cityguards pay little heed also, only stepping in when they believe the
fight is unjustified.

Main Street~
The continual stream of people on Main is no different here.  Clerics
clutch their holy books, Mages seem absorbed in scholarly thought, and
Warriors tote around their swords, blaring out curses at passersby who
accidently run into them.  The cobblestones of the street are well-worn by
the many hundreds of feet which pass over them every day, and the buildings
which line the street are very stout and seem prepared for any blow, natural
or unnatural.

Main Street~
A throng of people enter Main Street from the south, and you can hear the
chattering and bartering of people at a market.  Your pace is slowed down by
the continual flow of people, and the odor coming from the tightly packed
people is very intense.  Blending in with their odor are the varied smells
coming from the market.  You think you can detect the smell of food and
various potion-making herbs, and possibly even the smell of pet animals.
You push forward against the crowd, eager to see what the merchants have for
sale.

Market Square~
The Market Square is arguably the busiest intersection in all of
Bethaven.  Street vendors hawking illegal wares try to escape the notice of
cityguards.   Adventurers run from one store to another collecting supplies
for journeys outside the town, and common citizens meander down the streets.
The whole intersection is a swirling vortex of colors, odors, and sounds.
Clutching your head, you attempt to find a quieter place in the city.

Main Street~
Crowds of people swarm out of the Market Square to the north, jostling
each other as they vie for a good position in the crowd.  A small child
meanders out into the middle of the Street and gets cut off from its mother.
The wailing from the child and the answering shrieks of terror from the
panicked mother give you a headache.  To the south, Main street appears to
be less hectic.

Main Street~
The crowds have thinned out here, and you find the travelling manageable.
The occasional gruff adventurer shoves you out of his way, and beggars
approach you for a few coins.  Overall though, the journey is enjoyable.
Your feet make sharp clattering noises which echo off of the buildings
surrounding Main Street.

Crossing of Main and Tower~
Main Street intersects with Tower Street here.  Tower is aptly named for
the twin lookout towers which extend far above you to the east and west.
The cobblestones do not fit as nicely here, and the buildings surrounding
the intersection look old and run-down.  Compared to the world outside the
city gates, Bethaven is very safe.

lurking in the buildings along the street.  Off in the distance, you hear
the scream of some poor soul who is being beaten up by a ruffian.  The few
people you meet on the street avoid eye contact and look around nervously.

The crossing of Wayfairer and Main is pretty deserted, except for the
occasional drunk or adventurer.  Most of the city's inhabitants stay closer
to the center of town because the outer edges of the city tend to be more
dangerous and attract seedy individuals.  To the south, you can make out the
edges of the city gates.

Southern gate of Bethaven~
The southern gate of Bethaven is heavily guarded, and people seeking
entry and exit must give an extensive report to the guards.  Travelling
papers must be in order, or dire consequences can result.  The gates
themselves are very large and made out of polished oak.  They are barred
against invasion from the outside, and have never been penetrated.

Western gate of Bethaven~
The western gate of Bethaven is heavily guarded, and the gates are
sturdily barred.  The threat from an outside invasion is always present, and
Bethaven, with its great riches, is a prime target of raids.  The cityguards
look at you sternly, and question what business you have in the city.  In
the distance you can hear wagon wheels crunching over the road leading up to
the gate.

Corner of Trafar and Eternity~
The corner of Trafar and Eternity is rather unspectacular.  The buildings
which line the streets are simple dwellings made out of wood and native
stone.  The roofs are thatched with marsh grasses, and the outside of the
buildings are whitewashed.  The streets are made of fine cobbles which are
well-fitted by talented craftsmen.  Overall, the city of Bethaven appears to
be well taken care of, and the people seem to be wanting for little.  To the
north, you see the mighty northern gates of Bethaven.

Trafar Road West~
As you move along Trafar Road, you come across the occasional holy man or
woman who is deeply lost in religious ponderings.  The other travellers are
diverse and come from all of the corners of the realm.  The variation in
dress is remarkable, as are the differences in size and color of the people.
Just because there are so many different people does not mean they live
together in harmony, however.  The occasional scuffle between rival clans
keeps the blood flowing in the streets of Bethaven.

Trafar Road West~
The mix of people here on Trafar Road is fascinating.  Tiny pixies dance
and dart between the crowds as they avoid being squashed, their eyes
sparkling with excitement.  Great demons hulk over everyone, their piercing
and fiery gazes sending pangs of fear into the most seasoned warrior.
Occasionally, an even rarer humanoid is seen, like the slender and graceful
elves of the forest, who cast a disdainful look upon all they meet.
Overall, the mix of exotic peoples is astounding.

adventurers looking to tell their tales of glory.  Still others are pilgrims
seeking holy enlightenment, and there are scholars seeking the knowledge of
the sages.

A significant crowd of people here is impeding traffic.  Ahead is the
Fountain Plaza of Bethaven, which is a place of respite for road-weary
travellers and is on the road to the Temple of Bethaven.  Among the throng
of people are a significant number of the sick and the dying.  They are
probably being taken to the famed Oracle of Bethaven in the hope that a
miracle can be performed.

gather there.  Coming out of the plaza can be seen many of the most devout
religious men and women of the city.  Covering their heads and refusing to
speak with anyone, these religious fanatics speak only with their gods.  The
stench of the animals they sacrifice and burn is repugnant, and it clings to
their clothes like a baby clings to its mother.

Trafar Road East~
The peaceful tranquility along Trafar Road is exploded in an instant as a
fight breaks out between an adventurer of one clan and an adventurer of
another.  The citizens of Bethaven watch this development with bored
disinterest; their only concern is staying out of the crossfire.  These
fights between clan members are usually to the death, and the open warfare
between the clans is mostly ignored by the city, as long as none of its
citizens get pulled into the frays.

Trafar Road is peaceful here, and the crowds are thin enough that
movement is easily accomplished.  Here and there a loose cobble trips you up
as you walk along, betraying the age of the street.  Founded over a hundered
years ago, Bethaven was originally a small dwelling of peasants who gathered
together for protection against raiding bands.  Since that time, it has
grown into the incredible city that stands today.

the west.  The incredible number of people which visit Bethaven each day is
astounding.  It should not be too surprising, though, for Bethaven is the
center for commerce in the entire realm.

Corner of Trafar and Tempest~
The corner of Trafar and Tempest is ordinary in appearance.  The
cobblestone streets resound with the sharp footsteps of the many travelers,
and the utilitarian buildings which edge the street look warm and inviting.
The economic diversity of the people living in Bethaven is striking.  Women
wearing expensive jewelry and splendid clothing are just as common as the
beggars wearing rags and looking for their next meal.  You notice a small
rusty gate blocking a barren path leading northwards...

solid stone dragged in from the cliffs near the city.  The gates are equally

Tempest street is the beginning of one of the biggest residential areas
in Bethaven.  The houses here are made out of thick river stone and solid
wood from the nearby forest.  The roofs are thatched with tough marsh
grasses, and the entire structure is whitewashed.  Here and there, simple
touches made by the inhabitants have distinguished the otherwise identical
houses from each other.  Off in an alley, you hear the hiss of a stray cat.

in Bethaven.  Most of these people depend on back-breaking labor in the
mines to support themselves.

street.  Too tired to spend any energy crying about the pains in its belly,
it just looks at you with its haunting eyes.

could possibly persuade anyone to help them.  On occasion, a burly man can
be seen entering one of the dwellings, or a child can be seen peeking out of

spiritual guidance, and even receive money in exchange for prayers and

To the north is a weapon shop and smithy, and to the south Tower Street
leads off.  The incessant babble of people at the market is really annoying,
and the close press of so many bodies creates an awful stench.  Here and
there, you can see minor dispute erupt between people, and constant
bartering with street vendors goes on.

Merchant Street West~
Merchant Street continues to the east and west here.  To the north, a
very heavily guarded shop stands almost empty.  The sparkling jewels inside
indicate why.  Only the wealthiest members of the land, or adventurers
wishing to sell booty need bother with this store.  The common people of
Bethaven can only look and dream.

Merchant Street West~
This section of Merchant Street is especially busy.  To the north, the
scribe shop sells all manner of scrolls and magical wards.  Heading toward
the south are various members of the realm which are clutching vast sums of
money to their chests.  The iron bars in the window and the heavily armed
guards indicate that you are before the Bank of Bethaven.

heavily traveled Merchant Street.  Apparently, all of the traffic has caused
them to come loose.

south, veteran soldiers of the Bethaven army are on constant duty here.  Any
person entering this area should have a very sound reason why they are doing
so.  The army has much more important things to deal with than nosey

The famed Mercenary's Guild of Bethaven has able men and women of all
classes and races to rent as companions on dangerous adventures.  The cost
is not cheap, but the service is well worth any cost.  These mercenaries are
willing to lay down their lives for the person who rents their services.
They have little choice, for failing a client means a lifetime of indentured
servitude for the Mercenary's Guild.

Donation Anti Chamber~
Upon entering this rather small room, the first thing you notice is a
large brutish man standing in what looks to be a box with some arcane
writing scribbled on it.  The room has five exits all leading in different
directions.  Occasionaly you see a fellow adventurer leaving one of these
other rooms with a smile on their faces, and a new item strapped to their
backpack.

A Barren Path~
You are just inside the rusty gate. The land to the north looks barren and
desolate. A chilling wind blows from the hills nearby. To the south are the
familiar buildings of Bethaven.
The barren path continues eastwards along the city walls...

Outside the Northern Gates~
As you step out this northern gate, you notice immediately that this is
going to be a tough trip.  This area appears to be well travelled, yet
deserted at the same time.  It suddenly comes to you that though the path is
well marked, you don't think that many of the travellers have come back this
way.

Gruam's Smithy~
Gruam's Shop is swelteringly hot.  Sparks fly as Gruam pounds out metal
on an anvil.  His sweat-soaked body ripples with muscles, and he looks up as
you walk in.  Gruam's prices are reasonable, and it is very much more
affordable to fix an item than to risk life and limb in replacing a broken
item.

Bethaven Post Office~
Here is where the citizens of Bethaven congregate to find out the latest
news, communicate with one another, and just generally socialize.  Along the
back wall is a rack filled with pigeon holes.  Each hole seems to be crammed
with notes and such.  There is a &Rsign&c here.

surround you on pillars and walls.  Each possessing binding forces, for

The Morgue~
Somehow in your travels you have managed to prove your own mortality to
yourself, and those around you, by dying.  Fortunately, the gods were
watching you and took pity upon you, granting you a new body.  If you are
under level 20, your corpse should be here, if you are over level 20, you
must go back to where you died to get it.  You can get the items from your
corpse by typing GET ALL CORPSE.  If you wish to go to your temple, enter
one of the portals, either ravenwood or bethaven depending on which town is
yours.  Simply type enter bethaven or enter ravenwood to proceed.  Keep in
mind, if you are not evil aligned, and go to Ravenwood, you will be jailed
if you run into one of the guards.

QuestMaster's Quarters~
The only lumination in this room comes from a single candle burning
brightly upon a small table.  The sweet smell of incense pleasantly fills
the air, and the low strains of music seem to surround you.  Almost obscured
by the shadows is a wizened old man.  He turns to look at you as you enter.

Entrance to the Grand Arena~
You are standing in a small room.  The room is bare of any furnishings to
prevent any form of combustion.  Within the room is a portal which leads to
the Grand Arena.  It is safe to stand within the spectators area, but is
quite dangerous within the gladiator wings.
