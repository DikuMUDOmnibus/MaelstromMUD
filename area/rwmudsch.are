A muskrat~
A large muskrat furrows through some musty straw here.
~
This rat looks to weigh about 40 pounds, and is a true king of rats.
It's eyes are bleak and covered with a film brought on by the disease
infested filth in which it resides.  It appears frightened by your presence,
and waits to see your next move.

put up TOO much of a fight.

At the Entrance to Ravenwood Training School~
You are within an ancient hallway that reeks of sweat and blood.  Many
have passed through these halls, learning the lessons taught within,
becoming better adventurers with each step.  To the north, the school awaits
you, while below lies the training area where you can train your stats or
practice your skills (after level 3).  At any point, should you see a sign,
it would probably be best to LOOK at it, as it may contain vital information
for you.  You can get a better idea of where you stand with the SCORE,
INVENTORY, and EQUIPMENT commands.  Try them now.  When you are ready to
continue, choose your path and go.

Looking about you, you can see to the east and west of you are two small
rooms, each sending forth a different smell, neither scent being of the
pleasant variety.  You may enter either of these rooms to try your hand at
combat (type KILL and the monster name), or continue in the hallway to the
north and south. There is a &rsign&c posted here.

&rThere may be doors located in some places. They are not always easy to
find as they are sometimes not mentioned in the description of the room.
In this particular room there is a door to the south. To find a door, you
can simply walk in that direction and bump into it (if it is secret). You
can also LOOK <direction> which will tell you if there is a door there and
whether it is open, closed or locked. You can also try LOOK DOOR, but this
will not always work... if the door is hidden then you have to discover it
on your own.

Within the Academy~
Here, you are at a four way intersection, leaving you quite a few choices
of which way to go.  To your east and west are small rooms, while to the
north and south the school hallways continue.  Or perhaps, if you've already
done some fighting, you'd like to REST or SLEEP and regain some of the
hitpoints, mana, or movement points you may have lost in the struggle.

Within a Cramped Prison Cell~
This room is tiny, and unkept by those in charge of this academy.
Shackles are set into the wall, and a slab of wood mounted on a stone slab
serves as some sort of crude bed.  You may exit the cell to the west.

Within a Hallway~
The hallway continues on to the north and south from here, each direction
bringing you it's own challenges.  If you should find yourself in trouble,
FLEE to save your life.  To find out how well you would fare against a
prospective opponent, CONSIDER them to see how they stack up.  Hopefully you
have learned to GET ALL from the corpse of anything you have slain, and
SACRIFICED the corpse after doing so.  Type CONFIG now to see how to set it
so you will automatically do certain things and see other things of
interest.  One of the first you should do is AUTOEXIT.  This will
automatically show you the obvious exits from where you are.  Others are
AUTOLOOT (gets all from corpse) AUTOSAC (automatically sacrifices the corpse
to your deities) and AUTOGOLD (automatically gets the coins from the
corpse).

Before a Stairwell~
In this dead-end room in the halls of the school there is a staircase
leading downwards.  The room looks as though it has been inhabited by
someone for quite some time, and though it reeks of a stale stench, it is
still somewhat cleaner than most of the other rooms you have seen.  You may
travel down the stairs or leave the room to the south.

On a Landing in the Stairwell~
From this vantage point, you may travel in any of the six directions
(north south east west up down).  Thin candles are set into the walls here
giving off a dim glow, and filling the room with a sweet smelling smoke.
The next move is yours.  If you have advanced to the next level, you should
SAVE now.  To find out how many more experience points you will need until
the next advancement, type WORTH, which will show your current experience as
well as your needed experience for the next level, and gold coins in hand.

fresh air.  A pile of matted straw covers the floor, and you can definately
hear something crawling around underneath it.  You may exit the cell to the

The room is covered in dust from ceiling to floor, with many cobwebs
hanging in huge matted clump in the corners.  If you look closely, you can
see some sort of entangled creature, long since dead, yet large enough to be
the size of a large cat.  You may exit the room to the east.

The office is complete with a desk and chair, as well as trophies
collected from various hunting expeditions.  This is obviously the workplace
of one of the examiners of the school, who will test you on your finely
honed skills.  Rumor has it, the only way to graduate is to successfully
kill your teacher.  You may exit the office to the north.

At this point there are four small hallways running to the north, south,

leading down into a pit just below you.  A slight stench of something
brewing is coming from the west, while to the east you can smell some
freshly cooked food.

To the north of you stands a large door, which can be OPENed quite
easily, as it appears to be unlocked.  Beyond this door is the training
arena, where you can fight anything that gets in your way, and better hone
your combat skills.  There is a healer in this arena, so find him if you get
into trouble.  If you are in severe trouble and need to leave the arena
immediately simply ENTER one of the portals.  The portals are in every room
and are a safe gateway back to the upper floor of the academy.
