A scrawny horse of gold and rose colours is standing defiantly here.

of another plane of existance.

Top of the Staircase~
You stand at the top of a long spiraling staircase.  The rail is made of
black iron and the stairs themselves are made of red and gray marbled stone.
You look to the east of you and see a large set of double doors with ornate
carvings and silver door handles.  The stairs also descend to the landing
below you.

The Black Road~
You travel along a road that's as black as night.  The ground beneath you
is firm, but it isn't dirt or any other pavement you've seen before.  The
trees around you aren't the green of normal trees.  Their leaves have grown
in black, but they aren't dead.  The woods and bushes are oddly silent and
the only noises are coming from your movement along the road.

The Road to Castle Wyvern~
You walk along a black road towards a small, dark castle.  The trees and
plants around you are as black as night, but otherwise are as healthy as a
green plant.  Sometimes you can hear the eviling cackling of some unseen
creature nearby.  The road continues east and west towards the castle.

The Road to Castle Wyvern~
You stand on a black road in front of a dark castle.  The iron gates
before you give you a glimpse into a cobblestoned courtyard to the west.
Black trees and bushes grow on the road around you and the sky seems to be
dark with storm clouds.  You wonder if the light ever reaches this castle as
you feel an aura of evil eminating from it.

have been an oak but now is adorned with black leaves instead of green.  The

recently to take care of them.  Black hedges trimmed to look like different
scenes from out of your nightmares seem to come to life in the shadows.  The

of this long building, but none of them have doors on them, allowing the
inhabitants to roam free in here.  You finally notice that there's a large
open hole in the ceiling and a place in the center of the stable that looks
as if it's a launching pad.  You don't think you can exit out through the
roof, but an exit leads east from the stable.

cheery glow.  It seems to be very different from the rest of the castle you

Blood-stained chains are attaced to the altar, but not a single spec of
blood seems to have stained the altar itself.  Sceneless black tapestries
line the walls.  One of the tapestries seems to be blowing from a breeze
coming from somewhere behind it.  Doors lead out to the west and south.

china rest upon the table as if ready to sprout a grand feast at any moment.

off the wrong color light, for you are within a room with walls as red as
blood.  You reach out a hand to touch the walls and find it isn't blood
afterall.  The floor is carpeted in thick red fur of some type.  The walls
are gilded in gold trimming and glitter brightly, giving off the effect of
fire.  The only exit seems to be through a shadowy door to the north.

A very shadowy door stands here in the north wall.

Deep Within the Dungeons~
You move about in the dungeons beneath Castle Wyvern wondering where the
exit has gotten itself to.  The sounds of claws on stone and an occasional
hiss reaches your ears.  You adjust your armor as the heat in here starts to
get to you.  The dungeons look like they continue to the east and to the
south of you.

In the Castle Dungeons~
You are in the tunnels underneath Castle Wyvern.  The walls radiate heat
as if there may be fire just on the other side of them.  The limestone floor
echoes as you move along the tunnel, letting every living and non-living
creature in the dungeons know of your presence.  The tunnels continue
to the north and to the east of you.
