The Deity is the immortal advisor to a clan. Charged with upkeep of the clan
headquarters and items to be given out to it's members, the Deity is an
invaluable aid to all clan members. The Deity is also the clans voice when

the Deity is the highest ranking member of the clan, it is still run by the
mortal leadership, and only steps in when nothing else can resolve an issue.

the Gods. The individual Council members will delegate tasks through out
their area, as well as submit people to be promoted to a higher rank.

deserving of the respect and trust of their peers.

51 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of EOS **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)
~
-1 RULES~
These are the rules of EOS.  For other matters, use commom sense.

* foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on EoS, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.

* sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion

* your presence here is a privilige not a right
 
* no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
  You risk deletion should you be caught.
 
* Absolutely NO summonsing any mobs to Bethaven or Ravenwood.  I do NOT
   wish newbies jeopardized.  There's plenty of room outside those towns,
   use them.

-1 STORY~
In the beginning, the earth was... oh too far back.
*crumbles up help file and throws it away*
~
0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
51 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The spells command is used to display your character's list of available
skills and spells.  Slist will also show you all skills and spells available
to your character.  Skills and spells are listed showing amount of pts
(points) it costs for each particular one, when you type spells.  
~
0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist), typing it again removes
it. 
~
-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
101 HEDIT~
Command:
% hedit <name>
% hedit create <name>
asave 0 to save help files
~
105 ARGLIST~
The mobprog arglist changes from type to type.
For most types it is a percentage (1-100), and on others it is keywords
or an ammount.
I.e., for the hit_prcnt_prog, it's a percentage.. namely if the arglist is 30,
then when the mobs hp is at 30% or less of max, then the prog is triggered.
For give_prog, the arglist is all the keywords of the object to trigger that program
when the object is given to the mob.
And for all_greet_prog, arglist is a percentage, 100 will make the prog run
whenever anyone enters the room (excluding invis imms).
~
105 INEWS~
Numerous commands have been added.
Note:  vused
       wrlist
       mpedit
       hedit
       restrict
~
106 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict [commandname] [level]
Syntax: restrict [commandname] log [logtype]
 
Commandname is the name of the command you wish to change the level or
logtype of, you can use shortforms of commands giving there aren't any
other commands with those sames letters or you may not get the one you
wish. :)  Logtype is the type of logging you wish a command to have,
type restrict by itself for quick syntax and the logtypes.  Also,
it is possible to type:  restrict all [firstcmd#] [secondcmd#]
for a listing of commands and the levels which they are currently at.
Firstcmd# is the first command you wish to list from, and secondcmd#
is the number of the command you wish to list to.
~
101 WRLIST~
Syntax: wrlist [type(r/o/m/p)] [lvnum] [uvnum]
 
Wrlist lists the vnums and names of the items in those vnums.  You can list
room vnums and their names with r, objects with o, and mobs with m.  When
listing rooms, it also shows you the resets in each room.  Lvnum is the
beginning vnum you wish to list from, and uvnum is the ending vnum.
Note, with m, if the mob has mobprogs, it will list each of the
different types of mobprogs the mob has.  P will list all the mobs with
mobprogs within the range.  It will show the full mobprog: type, arglist,
AND comlist, unlike with m.
~
106 VUSED~
Vused simply lists all the blocks of vnums which have been created to date.
The last line it shows tells you just how many free vnums there are. :)

-1 HUMAN HUM~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wA very ordinary class, without any enhancements or drawbacks.
Good for players who are new to MUD games in general.
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 ELF~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wSpawned of the fairy folk, elvenkin have commonly been known as some of the
strongest sorcerers in the realms.  Born with an above average intelligence
most elves live far beyond the life expectances of their fellow creatures of
the storm.  At home in the forests, close to where their magic lay strongest,
elves can tap into the very source of their magical energy, allowing them to
regain their inner pools of magic twice as fast.  Though, long living, those
of the elven race tend not to have a below average stamina when it comes down
to physical fights.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Infravision.
&z*&w Spells cost them only 75% of the normal cost.
&z*&w Elves regenerate mana twice as fast as normal.
&WStat Modifications&w:
&CInt: &w+1, &CCon: &w-1
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 DWARF DWA~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wTaunted by other races for their unnaturally small height, dwarves prefer to
live alone in the sanctuaries of their mountain caves.  Very stocky by nature,
dwarves make excellent fighters, with their high stamina and natural resistance
to magical attacks, but as an average they lack the intellect pocessed by many
of the other races throughout the lands.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Infravision.
&z*&w +25% added to their save vs spell.
&z*&w Highest maximum of saving over other races.
&z*&R Forge&w: Allows a dwarf to forge specific equipment.
&WStat Modifications&w:
&CCon: &w+2, &CInt: &w-2

~
-1 PIXIE PIX~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wBeing very dextrous, pixies are great thieves.  They seem to lose out in
matches of physical strength, though.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Pixies naturally have the 'fly' spell on at all times.
&z*&w Pixies do not use movement points.
&z*&w Can't be tripped due to their flying abilities.
&WStat Modifications&w:
Dex: +2, Str: -2
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 HALFLING HLF~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wOf a height similar to those known as dwarves, halflings, often also called
hobbits, are a small, fun loving race of people.  Due to their tiny size and
naturally shod feet, protected beneath by patches of thick, short hair,
halflings are quick and light on their feet.  Even the slowest of these
creatures can sneak up behind you without you even noticing, a trait these
creatures have learned in order to survive would-be attackers.  Prefering to
hide away in their homes and stay out of sight or contact with any other
races while abroad, halflings generally don't accumulate the level of wisdom
found in the rest of the lands' races.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Being light in their step, a halfling is always sneaking.
&z*&w Their small stature keeps them from being detected.
  (Halflings can not be seen via the 'where' command.)
&z*&w Curious in nature and quick in sight, halflings can use the 'peek' skill
  as well as any thief.
&WStat Modifications&w:
&CDex: &w+2, &CWis: &w-2
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 DROW DRW~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wThe drow are a weaker race, but make up for their loss with their speed.
The drow are good for thieves.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Infravision.
&z*&R Drow Fire&w: Improved Faerie Fire & Incinerate skill attack.
&z*&R Globe of Darkness&w: Creatures of the dark, members of the drow race are able
  to cloak their surrounding area in completely darkness, cancelling the
  effects of any nearby lanterns of spells of magical sight.
&WStat Modifications&w:
&CDex: &w+1, &CStr: &w-1
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 ELDER ELD~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wNearly as ancient as the immortals themselves, these beings, commonly 
referred to as elders, hold a place of high respect among the realms of the
storm.  They often spend their entire life wandering throughout the lands, 
spreading their near infinate wisdom to those they meet and are constantly 
seeking new knowledge.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Elders do not use movement.  (They are never too tired to move)
&z*&w They naturally 'levitate' in the air at all times.
&z*&w Due to their floating nature, they cannot be tripped in combat.
&z*&w Spells cost 75% of the normal spell cost.
&z*&w Elders regenerate mana twice as fast as normal.
&WStat Modifications&w:
&CWis: &w+3, &CStr: &w-3
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 OGRE OGR~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wThese lumbering brutes, although not smart, have great strength, and
usually end up becoming the warriors of the Storm.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Ogres naturally have a shield to reduce damage by 1/20th.
&z*&w Natural form of enhanced damage.  (+1 damage per 10 damage done)
&WStat Modifications&w:
Str: +3, Int: -3
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 LIZARDMAN LIZ~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wA race with lots of hitpoints, Lizardmen make good fighters.  Their
offset to the hitpoints is their lack of speed.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Lizardmen don't use movement points.  (They never tire of walking)
&z*&R Spit&w: Utilizing the acidic fluids beneath their tongues, lizardmen are
  able to excrete a harmful venom often causing temporary blindness or
  inability to form the words necessary for casting.
&WStat Modifications&w:
&CCon: &w+2, &CDex: &w-2
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 DEMON DEM~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wBy far the race with the most hitpoints, demons are some of the best
warriors in the game.  Their major downfall is their lack of wisdom.
&W
&WRacial Abilities&w:
&z*&w Detect Invisibility.
&z*&w Detect Hidden.

0 CAST CASTING SPELL~
For all spell casting classes, once you reach a certain level, you recieve 
spells which you may practice, and then cast.  There are spells devoted to
protection, attack, healing, and one or two other miscellaneous subject
areas.  To be able to cast a spell, it must be practiced to at least 1% or
higher, otherwise you will eternally lose concentration.  Spell casting costs
vampires blood points, and with all other spell casting classes it costs mana.
How much mana or how many blood points it takes, is mainly dependant on what
kind of spell it is and how many levels you have been able to practice it.  As
you gain levels, spells that you had on previous levels will drop in mana/bp
cost.  To see how much mana/bp your currently practiced spells will
cost to cast, you may type SPELLS.  Typing PRACTICE will list all currently
practiced spells and skills.  Also, to see all the spells and skills that
your class will recieve, type SLIST.

game driver will replace what you typed with the string found in [new].

105 PARAMTYPES PTYPES~
All x_progs are triggered by certain actions, and then are passed through
a check to see if the trigger is activated.  There are various types
of parameters based on these checks, which are compared to the information
received by the game driver.
 
Percent Parameters:
  These are the most common kind of checks.  The parameter is a number
between 0 and 100, 0 meaning the trigger will never activate, and 100
meaning the trigger will activated every time it is called.
 
Word Parameters:
  These parameters may be specified in one of two ways: As a word list or
as a phrase.  As a word list, each word of the parameter is check against
each word of the incoming data, and if any of the words match, the trigger
will be activated.  A phrase parameter starts off with the letter 'p' as
the first word, followed by the phrase to be compared.  In a phrase, all
words compared much match (excluding the initial 'p').
 
Slot Parameters:
  These indicate a spell slot.  Spell slots may be found by using the
'slookup' command.  Be careful to use the SLOT and not the SN, as they
are two different numbers, used for different purposes.
 
Hour Parameters:
  This type takes two arguments: The starting hour and the finishing
hour.  These are called every game hour, and if the time is between the
two numbers, the trigger will activate.  Numbers must be in 24 hour format,
and may wrap around midnight.  (ie: '20 8' would activate every hour between
8:00pm and 8:00am, game time, every game night.)
 
Hitpoints Parameters:
  The parameters for this trigger is a number between 0 and 100, indicating
the percentage of hitpoints the mob has from its max hitpoints.  The trigger
is activated when the mobile's hitpoints to max hitpoints percentage fall
below the specified percentage.
 
Itemlist Parameters:
  This is a list of items which may activate the trigger.  Use quotation
marks (' or ") if you wish to use items with more than one keyword.
eg: 'orange dagger' as opposed to orange dagger.  The first example would
need an item with both names to activate the trigger, and the second
example would need an item with either name to activate.
 
Goldpieces Parameters:
  The ammount specified in the single parameter is the minimum ammount
of gold needed to activate the trigger.
~
101 MVARS MVARIABLES~
All mob_progs may use the following variables:
  $i, $n, $r, and modifications of these (like $e for $n)
 
prog name      | param type | useable variables
---------------+------------+------------------
act_prog       | word       | see below
speech_prog    | word       | (none)
rand_prog      | percent    | (none)
fight_prog     | percent    | (none)
death_prog     | percent    | (none)
hitprcnt_prog  | hitpoints  | (none)
entry_prog     | percent    | (none)
greet_prog     | percent    | (none)
all_greet_prog | percent    | (none)
give_prog      | itemlist   | $o
bribe_prog     | goldpieces | (none)
 
Note: rand_prog and entry_prog do *NOT* have a $n variable available.
 
For act_prog, the variables depend on the information received
Any action that involves an object may use $o.
Any action that involves two or more objects may use $o and $p.
Any action that involves a third party may use $t.
These actions do not have to be done by the programmed mobile.
ie: A person types 'give <object> <target>'.  $o becomes <object>, and
$t becomes <target>.  $t may be the same as $i if the mobile itself is
the target of the action.

1 BUILDING~
Eye of the Storm II perfers to have new and UNIQUE zones.  If the zone
is on anothermud please do not submit it here.  When you create an area for
use with EOSII, you give to the admin of the mud and those assigned by them
the right to use it and modify it on a permanent basis, because of the large
effort required by us to help you build the zone.  We retain the right to
use (or not use) any area submitted to us.  Once a zone is submitted and it
is linked into the mud the author of the zone gives up any rights to remove
the zone from the mud.  We will not give your area away without doing
everything in our power to ask your permission first and we kindly ask that
you do the same for us.  
 
If you feel you are qualified to build for us please speak to
Grunt, who is head of building here.
(Previous building experience is highly recommended)
~
1 NEWBIE~
To the absolute beginner:
 
Welcome to The Storm.  The Storm is a multi user Dungeon game or Mud for
short.  If you have gotten this far you have already chosen your race and
class.  Those choices you have made have created the character you are now
controlling.  You can make your character do almost anything by using a command
and pressing enter.  If your screen scrolls while you are typing just continue
to enter your command the mud will understand you.
 
 
Some commands to get you going are as follows:
   >look           and also 'look in <item>'
   >say            followed by the sentence you wish to say
   >who will show all visible players.
   >tell <person> and what you want to tell a person.
   >chat and what you want the world to hear.
   >exits          will reveal all obvious exits from the room you are in
   >north          will take you to the north if you can go there
   >south          -------------------- south -------------------
   >east           -------------------- east  -------------------
   >up             --------------------  up   -------------------
   >down           -------------------- down  -------------------
   >inventory      lists the items you carry
   >equipment      lists the items you are using
   >get <item>     to pick up an item
   >score          gives you your current score.
   >save saves your char and equipment.
   >quit  quits the game.
 
All commands can be abbreviated.  Thus the command 'look' can be abbreviated to
just 'l'.  Names of things and items can NOT be abbreviated, you must write
their full name to refer to them.  Be careful! Learn which abbreviations trigger
which commands.  For instance, 's' is an abbreviation for 'south' not 'say' and
sc is an abbreviation for score.
If you want to know more commands try just typing "help" by its self on a
line and press enter.  Also to find out more about commands try typing the
word "help" followed by the command for example try:
  help look
  help autoexits
For the extreem newbie and even the seasoned mudders we suggest you go through
mud school to learn how all the commands work.  In mud school you can do
everything from make your first few levels to buying a few needed items for
adventuring.
If you get stuck feel free to ask questions on the chat channel or check the
who list for a god with "Mortal Council" in their title.  Please try not to
bother other gods as they are usually very busy trying to add  to the world.
  From all the gods here at Storm we hope you have fun and wish your
  character luck as it runs into anything and everything.

The RANGER is a class devoted primarily towards hand-to-hand
combat.  The RANGER has a powerful affiliation with nature and
receives limited spells from the DRUID class repetoire.  Though the
RANGER does not have as many multiple attacks as the WARRIOR,
his spellcasting ability makes the RANGER a formidable foe.  Few can

many journeys, Bards have become jacks of all trades, but
masters of none.  They possess many spells and skills from
the different classes gathered as they wandered.

destroy and heal.

knowledge of the land allows them to draw magic from it.
They use nature as their ally, controlling it and shaping it to 
fit their needs.  Druids are the priests of nature, and the
guardians and protectors of the forests.
~
0 PALADIN~
The PALADIN is an incredible fighter that lives by his deeds.
As strong as a Warrior, the Paladin fairs well in battle.  His 
skills in the art of healing others make him an excellent
player to group with.  With luck, tales of a Paladin's deeds
will live long after that Paladidn has ceased to exist.
~
0 VAMPIRE~
The Vampire is a class that owns the night.  Their spells are
focused on draining the life from the living.  They get their power

powerful fighters that also receive the dual wield skill. A Vampire  
has a huge disadvantage in the sunlight, and must be indoors to
be safe from the suns' harmful light during the daylight hours.
~
102 NEWCORPSE~
Syntax: newcorpse <player> Syntax: newcorpse <player> <corpse #>
Newcorpse allows you to recreate a corpse for a player who has lost thiers. 
The player must be online in order for the corpse to be recreated.  The 5
most recent corpses will be saved.  Typing newcorpse <player> will display a
list of corpses and number of items each corpse contains The corpses will be
flagged as valid or invalid.  DO NOT recreate an invalid corpse.  The
newcorpse routine is fairly intelligent and will not save corpses containing
only one item.  Therefore if the player has died trying to get his original
corpse, and has only a light source, that corpse will not be saved.  Once
the apporiate corpses to be recreated is decided upon , typing newcorpse
<player> <corpse #> will recreate the corpse.  The corpse will be recreated
in the room in which you issued the command.

1 CLASS~
The MUD contains 13 classes, each varying in abilities and proficiencies.
The classes are as follows;
 
Mage       Cleric       Thief       Warrior       Psionisist       Druid
Ranger     Paladin      Bard        Vampire       Necromancer      Werewolf    
Monk
 
For information on each class, type help <class name>
~
101 PET_SHOP~
Pet Shops are one of the more tricky aspects of building, because a pet
shop requires 2 rooms in order to function correctly.  The first room is
where the person goes to buy their pet.  The second room is where the mobs
for sale are reset to.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that the second room be
the VERY NEXT VNUM after the first.  (Thus if the pet shop is room 1234,
then the second room where the pets are stored should be 1235) 
Room1: Gets the pet_shop flag. No mob is necessary but one just standing there
       pretending to be a shopkeeper adds to the reality. The mob is not a 
       shopkeeper, the room itself is the shopkeeper.
Room2: This is where you reset the mobs for sale. the mobs must have the flag
       'Pet' toggled under the act section. Prices are set by mob level.

~
101 INVOKE~
Ok builders,.... here's the info you all have been waiting for.
 
While in oedit, you have the possibility to do 5 things with INVOKE.
These are set by the ac_type command.  (See help AC_TYPE)  The most 
common of these is ac_type 5, which is for casting spells. Once you set the
ac_type, you then must fill in any other information required.  For casting a
spell, you must provide a spell (help ac_setspell) and a current and maximum
charge level (help ac_v1, and ac_v2).  To change an object from the current
one to another, you must provide a second object the current one will 
transform to (help ac_vnum).  Here's a sample for invoking invis:
 
ac_type 5
ac_setspell invisibility
ac_v1 5
ac_v2 5

method to get rid of corpses.
~

learning of this skill.  A Mage skilled in spellcraft is able to double the
power of his damage dealing spells.  
~
1 MULTIBURST~
syntax: multiburst <spell> <spell>
With this skill, a mage is able to summon enough energy within himself to

~
0 WEREWOLF WWF~
Werewolves are the beastly killers of the realm.  Using their claws and
jaws to fight, they have become more than equal adversaries to the warriors
of the lands.  They use all sort of tactics to frighten their opponents into
not fighting at their peak level.  
~
1 ENHANCED CLAWS~
Werewolves being animals, the adore fighting with their claws.  At an
early period in their lives, the develop a better fighting style with only

can call razor sharp claws bare hand, that is...)  
~

~
1 'ENHANCED CLAWS'~
This skill increases the damage a werewolf's claws do in combat.  The use of
this skill is automatic once practiced, but only works while the werewolf is
using his claws.  It will not give a werewolf any extra damage while the
werewolf is using conventional weapons.
~
1 'HOWL OF FEAR'~
Syntax: howl <target>
&w
Faced with the bellowing howl of rage from a werewolf's towering form, most
enemies will be stricken by a sudden overwhelming feeling of fear and paralysis.
Victims effected by a werewolf's beastly howl are generally disheartened and
therefor inflict less damage with each hit and find themselves too afraid to
press their oppenent making their hits landed fewer.
~
1 'ENHANCED REFLEXES'~
Syntax: enhance
Note  : This spell is the skill equivalent of 'haste' and is not accumulative
        with it.
&w
The art of fluid movement, trained by thieves and natural to werewolves, is
displayed through either of these graceful opponent's specialized reflexes.  By
concentrating on your objective and making yourself feel one with it these
groups of men, women and beasts are able to hone their skills and speed into a
near dance of gracefully dealt death allowing them to land blows faster than the
eye can keep up with.
~
1 'DUAL CLAWS'~
After gaining a certain amount of experience in the art of barehanded fighting
werewolves give up some of their defensive forms to learn the tactics of
attacking with both claws.  For them to be allowed this freedom of movement they
must not use a shield or hold any items, freeing their hands and arms enough to
allow quick movement.  This skill once learned is automatic in function and
works similar to 'dual wield', but does not require a second weapon to be used.
~
1 'RAKE EYES'~
&wSyntax: &Wrake <target>
&w
Sensing an opening in your defenses a trained werewolf will quickly
press his or her advantage by taking a swift and savage strike at your
eyes, gouging them with their sharp claws.  This attack will almost
always leave an opponent blind and wishing he'd paid closer attention,
but is not accumulative, due to it's damaging nature.
~
1 'DOUBLE BACKSTAB'~
A true master of the thieving arts might learn the skill of striking with not
one, but two backstabs.  Requiring the agility known only to a select few of the
world's adventurers, this ability demands a high mastery in the art of stealth
to slip behind someone and take them by surprise enough to land more than the
first backside blow.  Although while it has many advantages, this does leave a
thief's striking range rather short, since to strike multiple blows he must use
both hands with daggers ready.
~

~
106 IMM TOYS~
An Imm Toy is any item created by an Imm with illegal stats on it.
Illegal stats meaning something that would NOT be allowed in game.
Imm Toys cause more crashes and headaches around here, and that leads
to pissing me off, and you really don't want to do that.  Imm Toys are NOT
allowed, and if you've created any, delete them NOW!  There's enough 
Imm crap in game as it is.
~
1 AUTOQUEST~
&W Autoquesting is for every level and there are certain rules and
commands to know about.  &W You have to be at a Quest Master mob to use most
the available commands.  
&W
&wQUEST INFO:&W This will tell you what you are currently questing for.
&wQUEST TIME:&W Displays the amount of time you have left to complete your current
&W            quest or the amount of time until you can quest again if you just
&W            quested.
&wQUEST POINTS:&W This will tell you the amount of quest points you have so far.
&wQUEST REQUEST:&W This allows you to -request- an autoquest. The &cQuest Master&W
&W               will then see if it has a quest to give you.
&wQUEST COMPLETE:&W Once you've completed a quest, return to the &cQuest Master&W
&W                who assigned you the quest, and type QUEST COMPLETE.
&wQUEST LIST:&W This lists the available items you can buy with your quest points. 
&W            You must be at a &cQuest Master&W to list or buy items also.
&wQUEST BUY:&W To buy an item type QUEST BUY <item>.
&wQUEST AREA:&W When you are assigned a quest, you may type QUEST AREA to see what
&W            area your quest is in.
&W
 
&WAutoquests are random, and chosen suitable to your level. Sometimes you will
&Wget a quest to kill a mob, or a quest to find an object. If you are assigned an
&Wobject quest, the object is placed in the room of a suitable mob according to 
&Wyour level. You must go get the object and return to the &cQuest Master&W and
&Wtype QUEST COMPLETE.  He will then take the object from you and reward you with
&Wquest points.
 
&WIf you are assigned a mob quest, you must go find the mob and kill it, then 
&Wreturn to the &cQuest Master&W and type QUEST COMPLETE.  The mob you are to kill
&Wwill have a [TARGET] flag and while you are questing you will have a [QUESTING]
&Wflag.  
 
&R --- Before you begin questing, make sure you read HELP AUTOQUEST RULES ---
 
&WThe amount of time you are given for a quest is random, and can range anywhere
&Wfrom 10-30 minutes.  Once you have completed a quest, you must wait 30 minutes 
&W-REAL- time before you can autoquest again.  If you request a quest and the
&cQuest Master&W doesn't have a quest for you, you must wait 10 minutes before
&Wtrying to quest again.
 
&WThe points you gain while questing are saved every time you log off, but don't
&Wlast forever.  Each ten levels you lose any quest points you might of gained,
&Wfor example at level 10 you would be back at 0 quest points.  So quest lots and
&Wspend your quest points! Don't forget to read &RHELP AUTOQUEST RULES.&W Anyone
&Wwho doesn't abide by the rules will have to deal with the consequences. We want
&Wthis to be enjoyable for everyone.

&wMade from the joining of man and bull, these ancient creatures are
often found guarding various treasures throughout the realms of the land.
Born with massive strength and amazing stamina, these noble beasts can often
live centuries before passing on with only their slow movement, due to their
massive bulk, hindering them.  Using the dual horns of their head they can
often temporarily paralyse an enemy with one mighty slam of their head.

0 HEADBUTT~
&WSyntax:&w headbutt
&w
Minotaurs armed naturally with horns atop their head and built with the
strength of the combination of man and bull are able to use their massive
heads to cause heavy damage to an attacker.  As a minotaur gains experience
out in the world through their lifetime they are able to increase the speed
in which they recover from a sprawling headbutt and slam an opponent again.

melee combat are easier able to recover from performing a headbutt attack
before those of the magical profession.

0 'SONG OF MISSILES'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of missiles' <victim>
Summoning magic from depths of their souls, these wandering entertainers are
able to spread out magical missiles comprised of the strength of their voice.
~
0 'SONG OF VOICES'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of voices' <speaker> <message>
Having spent years training their voices in the arts of entertainment, many
bards have learned how to form the illusion of casting their voice from a
different direction.  Using this they can often make people believe that
someone entirely different from the bard said something they didn't actually
say.
~
0 'SONG OF EVIL SIGHT'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of evil sight'
Often having to travel from village to village entertaining in the local
inns and taverns, bards have learned to spot those of evil nature through
cautious observation, so they don't find themselves working for someone who
won't pay up after the performance.  This learned ability is invaluable to
a bard's pouch of gold.
~
0 'SONG OF ICY TOUCH'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of icy touch' <victim>
Modifying the tone of their trained voices, bards are sometimes able to not
simply give the sound of ice to their speech, but cause the actual freezing
of their opponent, spreading fear throughout the victim's soul.
~
0 'SONG OF NIGHT VISION'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of night vision'
After spending years training themselves to listen to the most acute of
sounds for musical perfection, bards have become adept at focusing into
sounds around them in the dark, where they can then use their eyes to focus
in upon the source of sound.
~
0 'SONG OF PROTECTION'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of protection' <target>
Taping into their arts of entertainment the skilled performer is often able
to strengthen the moral of their own fearing heart or that of their companion
with a simple song, causing the affected person to increase their ability to
keep out of harm's way.
~
0 'SONG OF EARTHQUAKE'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of earthquake'

skilled bard can bring about terrifying damage by shaking the very ground
around them with their voice.

Using their voice to entertain and relax a weary fighter, bards can offer

making their enemies fall to the ground in exhaustion.
~
0 'SONG OF ADRENALINE'~
&Wsyntax:&w sing 'song of adrenaline'
Using their voice as a cataclyst for focusing their thoughts and strength to
the task at hand, many bards can unleash the powers of the body through music

~
0 BLACKBELT~

monk is able to eventually achieve the status of a blackbelt.  One of this
skill level is able to attack with both hands instead of just one as the
begining monks do.  (Use of this skill is automatic once practiced, but you
can't be holding any item or wearing any shield or it will be disengaged.)
~
0 DROW FIRE~
&Wsyntax:&w df <victim>

can engulf their enemies in a terrifying display of flame.  Someone falling
victim to such an attack is often unable to flee the storm for safty and

0 'ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE'~
&wAfter spending years training in the martial arts, many monks further enhance
their studies in hand-to-hand combat learning the makeup of the human body.
This teaches them were the weaker places of the body, including the many
"pressure points" of the body, are, allowing them to cause massive amounts of
damage with a single touch.  Use of these pressure points can often lead to a
monk stunning an attacker in a single move or even on rare occassions lead to
an enemy's death.
&C(Use of 'anatomy knowledge' is automatic once trained.)
~
0 'FLYING KICK'~
&Wsyntax:&w flying  &C(while in combat)
&w
Highly trained in the martial arts, skilled monks often improve their kicking
abilities, using their incredible speed and agility to lauch themselves into

0 TRIP~
&Wsyntax:&w trip  &C(While in combat)
&wMaster thieves, pocessing a near perfect fluid grace to their movements, are
often fast enough to duck down low, using one leg to sweep an attacker's
legs out from under him, before their enemy is even aware of their
intenions.  This usually leaves the victim stunned on the ground as the
impact of the fall knocks the wind from him.
&C(Trip is similar to the warrior skill of 'stun' in it's effect.)

Having spent their lives training in the martial arts and learning where the
various pressure points of the body are, highly experienced monks are able to

short amount of time.  Due to this nerving attack an enemy can't get things,
quaff potions or retrieve their disarmed weapons, shield & held item until
the pain stops.

&WWhat is a flag?&w
When a player fails to steal successfully from another player they gain a
&z(THIEF)&w flag before their names and are now open game to be hunted down by
members of the &r[MERCENARY]&w guild.  Until their flag is removed, certain mobs
flagged as executioners will autoattack any thief they find.  Generally
you'll find such executioners at town gates and by healing facilities, but
not always.
&W
Removing your flag&w:
Quite simple.  You can't :).  Only by death from one of the &r[MERCENARY]&w Guild
can you lose your flag or by one of the IMPs deciding to pardon you, which is
extremely rare to never.  But that's the risks.

Thieves and werewolves of high level and experience are able to apply their
skills at the art of stealth into a form of stalking.  Able to simple disappear
into the shadows before your eyes, these shadow walkers can appear in the blink
of an eye.  Some areas, due to their conditions, are unable to support enough
shadows for their arts, such as deserts in the daytime.  Also their ability is
limited within a certain distance of range, due to the tiring strain of
attempting to remain unseen.
~
-1 'SIDESTEP'~
&wUtilizing the darkness of the shadows about them, people of the 'shadow' race
are able to dodge even the quickest of attacks, moving before an attacker's
eye can even register them.  &C(Sidestep has a base dodge % of 50 and goes down
1% per level the mob/player is higher than you.  Example: You (level 40

glass generally found on players of any value is that used in the creation of

&WSyntax&w: spit  &C(While in combat)

Using their own acidic saliva, lizardmen have become very adept at fighting
while spiting at their opponents.  The saliva causes a fair ammount of damage
and poisons the ennemy.  On occasion, they aim their spit at the facial part
of their ennemies, thus they can hit the eyes or mouth, rendering their
opponent either blind or unable to cast spells.

-1 'TRANSPORT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: transport <item> <player>
&w
Transport was created as a convience to players so they wouldn't have to use
the auction channel to pass items between themselves when they're far apart
throughout the mud.  There are a couple things to keep in mind here though:
&z
*&w This command is for your convience, do NOT abuse it in any way.  This means
  sending tons of items to a player that does not want them and loading up
  their eq for either annoyance or PK reasons.  I don't care the reasoning
  behind it, it's not here as a new PK strategy.
&z
*&w Please ASK a player before transporting them equipment to keep misunder-
  standings from occuring.
&W
Ok, now that that's out of the way, here's how it works:
&wYou type:&g  transport quill ashin
&wYou see:&g   You transport magical quill to Ashin.

1 'FORGE COSTS'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wWhile much of the work in a dwarf's forging is magic coming from the forger,
a good deal of supplies are needed for creation of equipment.  Here's a list
of what forging will cost you:
&WBase Cost&w: level * 10000 &Y<GOLD>  &C(level 30 = 30000, level 105 = 1050000)
