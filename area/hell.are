three fates women~
The Three Fates~
Three beautiful women are floating here in pouring white gowns...
~
&YThe Three women are equally endowed in physical beauty.

&rOn your left, floats a woman with eyes of the darkest chocolate and hair
of the blackest raven. Her oval face smiles at you, as her lips part into
a grin and her eyes turn up into a sneer.

&Y&OStraight ahead, a woman floats carelessly as her copper-tone hair flows
wickedly about her. Eyes of emerald green shine back at you, reflecting
the image of yourself in a frame of perfect lashes.

&wAt your right hand, there floats a woman bestowing locks of the purest
silver and eyes of the bluest lagoon. A suffusion of rose appears slightly
on her lovely cheeks as you gaze upon her.

&GThe choice is yours to make. Choose it wisely, for it IS your Fate.

necklace is about 4 feet in length if you were to unloop it. You may have to
string it around your neck a couple times for a proper fit.

Over towards the northerly direction (at least you hope that's still north),

There is a large slab of stone with many very small tablets atop it. The
