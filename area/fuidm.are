carrier falcon~
A carrier falcon~
A hungry carrier falcon is perched here.
~
The carrier falcon is preening its feathers with a gigantic, sharp beak
and eyeing you VERY watchfully.  He looks a little bored because there
aren't any messages to carry up the mountain, and wonders if you might be an
entertaining diversion.

A dwarven sentry~
A hidden sentry is watching for intruders.
~
You see one of the elite dwarven home guards.  She is short, sleek and
VERY fast.  Her cold, steel, grey eyes reflect many years in isolated posts
protecting the empire ...  Certainly no lady to antagonize!

mama falcon~
the mama falcon~
The mama falcon is here clucking contentedly.
~
The mother-to-be looks a little tired and haggard.  Her normally slim
functional physique is now plump and too slow to carry on the normal duties
of the carrier falcon.  She is more protective than usual however.

Here stands a sturdy looking dwarven sentry.  You can see the fatigue on
his face, but he stands strong at his post.  He glares at you as you enter
and he asks you what your doing there.  Better tell him quick!

You've never seen a snake this long or huge before.  It's fangs are like

ready for the ultimate strike!

Forest Path~
Tall pine grow on both sides of this dim path.  As you crane your neck
and look up you notice the branches above you swaying in a restless, very
spooky manner.  Strange bird calls, almost like warnings, sound from the
thick branches.  You begin to be a little worried when you realize this dark
trail might be the perfect place for an ambush.  The trail thins out to the
east.

Twist in the Forest Path~
As you come to this point, you can see some boulders partially blocking
your passage to the north, but leaving just enough space for you to get
through if you squeeze a bit.  The main path ends abruptly here, however,
you can spy some sort of thin animal-made path running to the east, as
though made by horses.

Base of Mountain~
The brush and shrubs here rip and tear annoyingly at your armor.  Bugs
are dancing little sadistic bug dances in your face.  As you move thousands
of bugs stir, and begin to blur your vision.  You almost don't see the
obvious man made constructions to the east and west.  A rocky path also
continues to the north.

Outpost~
This is a very stout and very formidable advance fighting enclosure. 
There's hardly enough room to turn around and the peep hole slots are set
very low on the wall.  In your infinite wisdom you deduce short people,
specifically ONE short person is all that could fit in here.  The only
obvious exit is back to the west.

Outpost~
You've escaped the bugs and brush by diving carelessly to your west.  As
you land spread-eagled on your face, you can't help but notice the solidly
hewn pine walls and little slots for spying or defensive fighting.  This
looks like a forward-observer position.

Rocky Path~
Rock fragments cover the path as you begin climbing a tall mountain path.
Some of the rocks are blood stained, and there is some very old looking
armor lying scattered about.  There appears to be a "safe" way up to the
west.  The path also continues to the south.

Small Cliff~
The path ends here before a short cliff with convenient toe-holds in it
so you can climb up.  It looks easy.  Maybe too easy ...

Treacherous Path~
The oxygen is getting a little thin but, thankfully, so are the bugs.  As
you look down you notice only one false separates you from a rather lengthy
swan dive to the bottom.  There is a path that heads east, but it doesn't
look any safer than where you are standing now.

Mountain Path~
You continue huffing and puffing up the mountain.  The trees are thinning
out and you see a wide panoramic view of the forest in the distance below. 
This wouldn't be a pleasant place for an attack because the only spot to
hide is in the recent avalanche of rocks and boulders to the east.

Below a Ledge~
You grasp desperately for handholds among the few shrubs clinging to the
steep mountainside and keep a weary eye out for snakes and other alpine
predators.  Your precarious toe hold slips, and loose gravel clatters away.
Fortunately, a shrub stops your descent.  Unfortunately, it appears to have
stopped a very large snakes descent also.

Falcon Nest~
This ledge is large enough for one falcon.  You notice she's made a comfy
nest here of twigs and branches and bones, but you don't see any eggs.  You
realize that the nest isn't quite finished yet.  Might want to leave before
she comes back to finish it.

Sheer Drop~
You catch the faint whiff of wild flowers here.  Looking down you can see
a straight drop to the base of the mountain, and looking up you see a lot of
sky...  But can't quite see what lurks at the top of this steep incline.  If
you climb up, you'll probably find out though.

On a Thin Forest Trail~
As you move along the trail, you notice that heading eastward, the trees
are much thinner than those to the west, and the ground is much more level. 
Off in the distance you can glimpse what appears to be wide open plains, yet
you cannot be sure.  The path continues to the east and west from here.

On a Path Through the Plains~
The ground has pretty much leveled out here, and the trees have given
way to grass and small bushes.  The path which you are following is widening
slightly, and many sets of hoofprints are evident here.  The path continues
to the north and west.
