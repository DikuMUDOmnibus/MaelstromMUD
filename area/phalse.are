Before a Snowy Valley~
You have been trudging through the Wasteland of the Artic for hours, or
has it been days - "?"  - you don't know.  Your eyes are perpetually
freezing open and/or shut.  Why did you decide to come here?  Adventure!
Not likely.  You are walking through a pass, between hills.  As you come to
the other side, you think you see a &gValley?  &cThe weather certainly can't
get worse.  So you may as well continue.

&YBefore a &WWinter &BWonderland~
&WUtterly Amazing!  &cYou are standing at the top of a Wonderous Valley.
The snow has lightened to a gentle fall.  Below you is a large village.  You
can see forms moving about.  The village is at the very bottom of the
valley, luckily the way is not treacherous.

Down You Go.~
A bit slippery, but not bad.  As you descend into the valley, the
&Wsnow's &cdepth is lessening.  All around you are &Wsnow &cdusted
Evergreens.  You can see more of the village now.  In the center of the
village is a great House.  All about are smaller houses.  It is quite a
lovely scene.
