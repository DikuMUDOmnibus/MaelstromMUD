Tower of Sorcery~
&cAmidst a cold and dark corridor, where light illuminates from tiny
wafers of air, you find yourself immersed in a shower of hyper-awareness. 
Particles of energy form at the base of your spine then travel slowly upward
creating a most unimaginable feeling.  Something with in the air, or perhaps
the air itself, is forming your thoughts and deeds.  This is not the place
for mere mortals to adventure freely, for the fibres of all that is magical
in the land connect infallibly at the core of all that is around you.  To
the north lies a massive wooden door, with carved faces for a frame. 
Whatever the secret be that lies beyond the door will be surely kept upon
your imminent death.

The Tower of Sorcery~
&cImmediately upon your untimely entrance the door crashes shut behind you
with an echo that sends tremors down the magical hall that lies before you. 
Several groans reveal themselves from the mist that clutters your vision. 
You have the feeling that your vision isn't going to help you for what you
see dimly though the mist, is not part of your present reality.  It seems
things are about to change forever.  A scream shrieks in the distance and
the floor that was to the north shatters and caves into nothing.  Tilting
your head up in utter despair an emerald vortex errupts, swirling near the
speed of light, slowly hypnotizing you.

Shifting Stones of Zohar~
Like the time before only more drastic, the emerald vortex caves leaving
you to observe your new surroundings.  You stand on a one foot cubed square
which is marked with a strange and mystically symbol.  Identical stones head
off into the distance only to cave into nothingness in a ten foot radius
about you.  None of the four cardinal directions visually exist, however
your soul reveals that all are possible.

Suddenly you find yourself in a great hall.  The ceiling rushes up nearly
twenty feet into the thin air about you.  The carpet is red, and the walls
are decorated with paper marked with a yellow print of lizards and lions. 
You feel calm and safe, however a little confused as to how you actually got
here.  Magic fills the halls, as you look off into the north.

creating a marvelous spectrum of light that dances down onto the page, who
awaits his and her majesty of wands' orders.  Taking a deep breath your body
is filled with a magical sensation.  To the north, east and west huge doors
protect the royal souls.  All may seem safe, however surely by now you
should have realized that what you see and feel, isn't always the truth.

The Tower of Sorcery~
Both the ceiling and floor seem to be encrusted with a swirling vortex. 
You can feel a cold draft coming from the east, and a red light seems to
flicker deep within a cave to the west.  You are continually amazed at how
surreal this tower is.  In fact it's very difficult to believe you are in a
tower at all.

Edge of the Tower~
You see a cliff to the east, however the fool seems to be quite unaware
of this.  It seems that if one were to venture of to the east and follow the
fool, it would most likely result in your death.  The fool is selling stuff
that is fit for a fool, however one can never be to sure about price or
value when dealing with a fool.  Perhaps the Fool only needs a friend to
straighten him out.  There is a sign here.  A VERY BIG SIGN.

Zohar's Cave of Seclusion~
You have entered a dark cave lit by a single reddish candle.  The candle
flickers slightly as a man enters through the shadow before you.  He is
a sage, and master to all that lingers deep within this omnious tower.
He has lived here since the banishment of the major arcanes before the
storm, or the great wipe.  Incense burns filling the air with a marvelous
odour quaking your body with a frenzy of warm fuzzies.  The Hermit knows
all about the tower, and is more than willing to help you on your quest

Tombstone~
You are DEAD!  You have wondered aimlessly through out the Anti-Nexus
without hope of success, and now you shall rest eternally.  The gods have
placed a tomb prepared for especially for such an occasion.  Rest in peace,

Meeting Death~
Upon eternal rest, you hath met your death!  All around corpses mark
those who hath offended the master, and now ye shall become dust like so
many before you.  This be thine judgement!  Pray that Death takes pity on
your soul!  Pray that your soul and corpse may be joined to live another
day!
