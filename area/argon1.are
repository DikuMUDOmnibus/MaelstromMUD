You find youself standing upon the northern river bank.  To the north of
you, you see a large cavern cut into the base of an immense mountain.  As
there is no other place to go, you may as well see what's inside.

Edge of Rylacs river~
You are standing at the very edge of a huge and perilous looking river. 
Looking across, you can't quite see what's on the other side, perhaps the
ferryman would be able to enlighten you about what's across the way, and how
to get there.
