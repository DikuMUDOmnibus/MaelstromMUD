&rHell~
&RHere you find yourself in a plane of eternal fire.  Flames lick and
dance at your hands and feet, and peer intently at your eyes, just on the
verge of being able to taste you.  You wonder what you could have possibly
done to end up here...  Perhaps you should rethink your actions of the past,
you believe it is punishment.  &w

The Coder Room~
This is a room where the coders can get together and talk about things
way over Thal's head.  Then, when you get really bored, you can start
documenting the entire code into pseudocode and flow charts.

&cMithrandir's Haven~
&CMithrandir the new God dwells here.  Books are scattered on the floor,
&Csignifiying the amount of learning Mith is doing to become a good god.
&Cyou see strange paintings on the wall, and a glowing sword hangs from
&Chooks on the wall.  You also see some curious inscriptions by the sword...

Forbidden Path~
The pristine tunnel known as the forbidden path bends to the east.  From
the East a blast of warm air hits you like a hammer.  Further on the path
darkens into a tunnel.

Frag's Hovel~
You are in a small, miserable, dwelling (for those of you nincompoops who
don't know what a HOVEL is).  It's dark, dank, and cold.  At one end of the
room you see a sorry excuse of a rusty, squeaky bunkbed.  Obviously, neither
of the beds are made.  A dirty, ragtorn teddy bear sleeps heavily on the
lower bunk.  You see, to your dismay, TWO clock radios, both of which are
ringing, which shows that this room was made for TWO people to sleep in,
although it's barely 10 X 12 feet.  Papers, books, and laundry are thrown
everywhere, with two computers astrally linked to the world of Envy.

Altrag's Lair~
&YThis place seems to be caught in between dimensions.  Prismatic colors
float by you in swirls, and you hear strange cries coming from what appears
to be nowhere.  Behind you a large hole suddenly rips through the fabric
of time, and a large dragon, rippling and barely visible against the
swirling vortex, comes through the tear, which promptly closes after the
dragon's entrance.
