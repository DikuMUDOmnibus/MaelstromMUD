strange warmth in the air.

Strangely brown moss clings erratically to the trees around here.  Around
you are allot of small little plants poking out of the ground.  The ground
is barren with only a dusty dirt covering it.  There is a strange howling
noise coming from the distance.  The smell of living plants hangs heavy in
the air.  There is the feeling as if something is watching.
