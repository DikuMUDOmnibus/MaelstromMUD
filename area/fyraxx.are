Baby Dragon~
A Baby Dragon~
A cute baby dragon toddles around here.
~
This cute little baby dragon must have been abandoned at a young age.  It
wanders the grounds of the Dragon Orphanage.  Every once in awhile it spits
out a bit of fire, though it is a small amount.

The baby looks up at you with interest, studying this foreigner.
