# Maelstrom

Maelstrom is a work-in-progress multi-user dungeon. Maelstrom is a derivative of the Entropy of the Soul codebase, which is in turn a derivative of Eye of the Storm II codebase, a drivative of [EnvyMUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnvyMUD), a derivative of [Merc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merc_(MUD)), a derivative of the original [DikuMUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD) (DikuMUD begat Merc, who begat Envy, and so on and so fourth).
