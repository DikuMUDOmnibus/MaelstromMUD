# OASIS MUD

OASIS is a work-in-progress MUD with the ultimate goal of building a modern DikuMUD variant inspired by the OASIS, as described in Earnest Cline's "Ready Player One."

OASIS is a derivative of the Entropy of the Soul codebase, which is in turn a derivative of Eye of the Storm II codebase, a drivative of [EnvyMUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnvyMUD), a derivative of [Merc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merc_(MUD)), a derivative of the original [DikuMUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD) (DikuMUD begat Merc, who begat Envy, and so on and so fourth).
